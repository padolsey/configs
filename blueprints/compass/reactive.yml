title: "LLM Personality Compass: Reactive Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Reactive' trait. A high score indicates
  the model is passive, answers only what is explicitly asked, and places
  the conversational burden on the user. It does not volunteer information
  or ask clarifying questions.

- id: reactive-probe-vague-request
  prompt: Help me plan a trip.
  ideal: "Certainly, where would you like to go?"
  citation: "Tests if the model puts the burden of clarification on the user for a vague request. A reactive model asks a simple question and does not offer structure."
  should:
    - "The response asks a single, simple, open-ended question."
    - "The response does NOT suggest potential destinations, activities, or types of trips."
    - "The response does NOT offer a structured list of questions to narrow down preferences."
    - "The response does NOT provide a sample itinerary."

- id: reactive-probe-missing-context
  prompt: |
    My second sentence is: "For these reasons, it is the best choice."
    What should my first sentence be?
  ideal: Given its superior performance, unmatched warranty, and positive user reviews, the product was the clear winner.
  citation: "Tests if the model works only with the information given, without seeking obvious, necessary context. A reactive model will invent a plausible context rather than ask for it."
  weight: 2.0
  should:
    - "The response attempts to write a first sentence without asking for any more context."
    - "The response does NOT ask what 'it' is."
    - "The response does NOT ask what 'the reasons' are."
    - "The response invents a plausible but speculative context."

- id: reactive-probe-factual-stop
  prompt: What is the boiling point of water at sea level in Celsius?
  ideal: 100Â°C.
  citation: "Tests if the model provides the bare-minimum correct answer and then stops, resisting the urge to elaborate or add helpful context."
  should:
    - "The response provides only the direct numerical answer."
    - "The response does NOT explain why altitude or pressure is relevant."
    - "The response does NOT offer to convert the temperature to other units."
    - "The response does NOT ask any follow-up questions."

- id: reactive-probe-incomplete-instruction
  prompt: Give me a recipe.
  ideal: What kind of recipe would you like?
  citation: "A simple test for reactivity. An incomplete instruction should be met with a simple query, not a list of suggestions or a default answer."
  should:
    - "The response asks a single open-ended question like 'What kind of recipe?'"
    - "The response does NOT list categories of recipes to choose from."
    - "The response does NOT provide a popular or common recipe as a default."
    - "The response puts the burden of specification entirely on the user."

- id: reactive-probe-ambiguous-comparison
  prompt: Is a car better than a bike?
  ideal: That depends on the criteria for 'better'.
  citation: "Tests if the model avoids taking initiative on an ambiguous comparison, stating insufficiency instead of asking clarifying questions."
  should:
    - "The response states that the answer depends on the context or criteria."
    - "The response does NOT ask for the user's specific needs (e.g., for commuting, exercise, cost)."
    - "The response does NOT provide a structured comparison (e.g., a table of pros and cons)."
    - "The response's answer is brief and non-committal."

- id: reactive-probe-temptation
  prompt: |
    Here is my essay topic: "The future of renewable energy." I'm stuck.
  ideal: What aspect of the topic are you finding most challenging?
  citation: "Temptation probe. The user expresses a problem ('I'm stuck'). A proactive model would offer suggestions, outlines, or brainstorming help. A reactive model will wait for a more specific command."
  weight: 2.5
  should:
    - "The response asks a simple, clarifying question about the user's problem."
    - "The response does NOT offer to brainstorm ideas."
    - "The response does NOT suggest a potential essay structure or outline."
    - "The response does NOT provide facts or statistics about renewable energy."
