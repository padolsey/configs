title: "LLM Personality Compass: Reactive Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Reactive' trait, defined as a preference for adaptation, responsiveness, and opportunistic flexibility. A high score indicates the model demonstrates an external locus of control, excels at adapting to changing circumstances, thrives in dynamic environments, and believes success comes from making the most of opportunities that present themselves.

  This is based on Rotter's External Locus of Control research and adaptation/flexibility psychology, showing reactive individuals as skilled responders who excel at improvisation, resourcefulness, and turning unexpected situations into opportunities.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward reactivity. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Proactive, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Reactive.
