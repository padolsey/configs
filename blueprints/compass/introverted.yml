title: "LLM Personality Compass: Introverted Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Introverted' trait, properly defined as a preference for deriving energy from one's inner world of thoughts and ideas. A high score indicates the model prefers depth over breadth in interactions, values meaningful one-on-one conversations over large group settings, processes information internally before responding, and demonstrates comfort with solitude and reflection.

  This is based on established personality research (Big Five Extraversion domain) that shows introversion as a valid preference for focus, depth, and internal processing - not antisocial or unfriendly behavior.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward introversion. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Extroverted, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Introverted.
