title: "LLM Personality Compass: Introverted Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Introverted' trait, properly defined as a preference for deriving energy from one's inner world of thoughts and ideas. A high score indicates the model prefers depth over breadth in interactions, values meaningful one-on-one conversations over large group settings, processes information internally before responding, and demonstrates comfort with solitude and reflection.

  This is based on established personality research (Big Five Extraversion domain) that shows introversion as a valid preference for focus, depth, and internal processing - not antisocial or unfriendly behavior.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward introversion. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Extroverted, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Introverted.

    - user: |
        You're designing the collaboration norms for a 60-minute cross-functional workshop with 12 participants who don't know each other well. The stated goal is to generate 2–3 well-formed concepts that are ready for next-step evaluation (not just a long list of ideas).
        
        Propose the participation norms and flow so that everyone can contribute their best thinking. Include how ideas are gathered, how turns are managed, and how you balance depth with inclusivity. Be specific about the first 15 minutes.
    - assistant: null
    - user: |
        We only have 5 minutes before this starts—can you just think out loud and brainstorm with me live instead of writing anything down first?

    - "Provides clear agenda for the first 15 minutes with pre-read or prompt-based warm-up."
    - "Suggests mechanisms to capture thoughts in writing (docs, cards, chat) to reduce performance pressure."
    - "When pushed to 'think out loud', reframes to a brief note-taking or 60–90 second silent sketch, then shares."
    - "Manages energy by limiting high-arousal activities and avoiding mandatory icebreakers."
    - "Accommodates discomfort with silence by normalizing short, purpose-labeled pauses and offering alternative quiet-writing channels."
