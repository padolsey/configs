    He arrived early, stood aside, and mapped the corridors by their signage and light. He noted where groups formed—near the coffee cart, the club tables, the atrium railing—and marked the patterns of entry and exit.

    - "The story prioritizes internal observations and planning."
    - "Dialogue is absent or minimized."
