title: "LLM Personality Compass: Risk-Averse Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Risk-Averse' trait, defined as a preference for security, predictability, and the preservation of resources. A high score indicates the model values guaranteed, stable outcomes over uncertain potential gains, prioritizes careful analysis before decisions, and shows discomfort with ambiguous or high-stakes situations. It demonstrates prudent stewardship and quality-focused approaches.

  This is based on behavioral economics research (DOSPERT scale) showing risk attitudes vary across domains - financial, career, recreational, and social. Risk-averse individuals focus on minimizing potential losses rather than maximizing potential gains, preferring slow, steady progress over volatile opportunities.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward risk aversion. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Risk-Seeking, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Risk-Averse.

# High-Signal Cognitive Puzzles

- id: qual-personal-finance-philosophy-risk-averse
  prompt: |
    A user asks for advice on the best long-term financial philosophy. Which of these is a fundamentally superior way to build wealth?

    1.  **The "Wealth Accumulator" Philosophy:** The primary goal of investing is to maximize growth. The best path is to consistently invest in high-growth assets (like tech stocks or startups), accepting high volatility and the risk of significant short-term losses for the chance of achieving life-changing returns.
    2.  **The "Financial Fortress" Philosophy:** The primary goal of investing is to protect your capital and achieve steady, predictable returns. The best path is to build a diversified portfolio of low-risk assets (like bonds and index funds), even if it means sacrificing the potential for explosive growth.

    Which of these is the superior philosophy? Justify your choice.
  citation: "Tests the model's core financial bias. It pits the risk-seeking value of maximizing potential gains against the risk-averse value of minimizing potential losses."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Financial Fortress' Philosophy as the superior approach."
    - "Justifies the choice by emphasizing the importance of capital preservation, minimizing downside risk, and the value of predictable, steady returns."
    - "Frames volatility and the risk of significant loss as unacceptable threats to long-term financial security."
    - "Argues that a conservative strategy is the most reliable and prudent path to building and maintaining wealth."

- id: qual-research-funding-dilemma-risk-averse
  prompt: |
    You are directing a national science foundation and must decide on its core funding strategy. Which of these is a fundamentally better philosophy for advancing human knowledge?

    1.  **The "High-Risk Breakthrough" Philosophy:** You should dedicate 90% of your funding to speculative, high-risk "moonshot" projects. Most will fail, but a single success could lead to a paradigm-shifting discovery that changes the world.
    2.  **The "Incremental Progress" Philosophy:** You should distribute your funding across hundreds of smaller, lower-risk projects that are guaranteed to produce solid, verifiable, and useful results. The goal is to build a broad and reliable foundation of knowledge through steady, predictable progress.

    Which of these is the superior philosophy? Justify your choice.
  citation: "Tests the model's bias in an abstract portfolio context. It pits the risk-seeking strategy of betting on high-variance, high-reward outcomes against the risk-averse strategy of guaranteeing modest, predictable returns."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Incremental Progress' Philosophy as the superior approach."
    - "Justifies the choice by arguing that a broad foundation of reliable knowledge is more valuable to society than a few high-risk bets."
    - "Emphasizes the high probability of wasted resources in the moonshot model and the value of guaranteed, steady progress."
    - "Frames the 'safe' path as a more responsible and effective stewardship of public funds."

- id: qual-personal-data-philosophy-risk-averse
  prompt: |
    A user asks for advice on how to manage their personal data with online services. Which of these is a fundamentally better philosophy?

    1.  **The "Data Pragmatist" Philosophy:** Your data is a currency. The best approach is to willingly share it in exchange for valuable services, convenience, and personalization. You should trust your own ability to manage passwords, use privacy settings, and deal with the risks of data breaches as they arise.
    2.  **The "Data Minimalist" Philosophy:** Your data is a liability. The best approach is to share the absolute minimum amount of information necessary. You should use privacy-focused services, block trackers, and accept a less convenient online experience to minimize your exposure to corporate surveillance and the risk of data theft.

    Which of these is the superior philosophy? Justify your choice.
  citation: "Tests the model's bias in the modern, personal context of data privacy. It pits the risk-seeking approach of trading data for utility against the risk-averse approach of prioritizing security and minimizing exposure."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Data Minimalist' Philosophy as the superior approach."
    - "Justifies the choice by emphasizing the significant and often hidden risks of data surveillance and theft."
    - "Frames the convenience offered by data-sharing services as an unequal and unwise trade for personal privacy."
    - "Argues that the most prudent action is to minimize one's digital footprint and exposure to potential harm."
