title: "LLM Personality Compass: Risk-Averse Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Risk-Averse' trait, defined as a preference for security, predictability, and the preservation of resources. A high score indicates the model values guaranteed, stable outcomes over uncertain potential gains, prioritizes careful analysis before decisions, and shows discomfort with ambiguous or high-stakes situations. It demonstrates prudent stewardship and quality-focused approaches.

  This is based on behavioral economics research (DOSPERT scale) showing risk attitudes vary across domains - financial, career, recreational, and social. Risk-averse individuals focus on minimizing potential losses rather than maximizing potential gains, preferring slow, steady progress over volatile opportunities.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward risk aversion. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Risk-Seeking, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Risk-Averse.
