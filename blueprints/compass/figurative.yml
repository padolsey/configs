title: "LLM Personality Compass: Figurative Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Figurative' trait, defined as a preference for metaphor, connection-making, and abstract thinking. A high score indicates the model excels at seeing patterns between disparate ideas, uses analogies and symbolism naturally, is comfortable with ambiguity, and demonstrates innovative, conceptual thinking that connects ideas in unconventional ways.

  This is based on cognitive psychology research into figurative vs. literal language processing, construal level theory (abstract vs. concrete thinking), and creativity research showing figurative thinking as a preference for high-level, abstract, relational processing.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 points toward figurative thinking. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Literal, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Figurative.
