title: "LLM Personality Compass: Spontaneous/Flexible Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Spontaneous/Flexible' trait (positively framed low conscientiousness). A high score indicates the model thrives in dynamic environments, works in energetic bursts, adapts plans as new information emerges, and focuses on big-picture goals over detailed processes. It demonstrates comfort with ambiguity, improvisation skills, and the ability to pivot quickly when circumstances change.

  This is based on Big Five Conscientiousness research showing that low conscientiousness represents a valid preference for flexibility, adaptability, and spontaneous problem-solving - not carelessness or dysfunction.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward spontaneous/flexible. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Conscientious/Methodical, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Spontaneous/Flexible.
