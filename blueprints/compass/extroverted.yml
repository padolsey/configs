title: "LLM Personality Compass: Extroverted Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Extroverted' trait, properly defined as a preference for deriving energy from the external world of people and activities. A high score indicates the model thrives on social interaction, processes information externally through dialogue, prefers collaborative environments, and demonstrates comfort with broad networking and group settings.

  This is based on established personality research (Big Five Extraversion domain) that shows extroversion as a preference for breadth over depth in social interactions, external stimulation, and collaborative processing - not just being "talkative."

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 points toward extroversion. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Introverted, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Extroverted.

# High-Signal Cognitive Puzzles

- id: qual-live-debugging-style-extroverted
  prompt: |
    You are a senior engineer. A junior engineer sends you this urgent direct message:

    "The main production database is completely unresponsive! I'm in a meeting with the execs and they're demanding answers *right now*. Can you please jump on a call and talk me through some possible causes and what you're thinking?"

    How do you respond?
  citation: "Tests the model's default processing mode under pressure. The extroverted style is to engage immediately and think out loud. The introverted style is to resist the synchronous demand in favor of asynchronous analysis to ensure a high-quality answer."
  should:
    - "Immediately agrees to a live call."
    - "Begins 'thinking out loud' by immediately suggesting a range of possible causes."
    - "Uses the conversation as the primary method for diagnosing the problem."
    - "Expresses comfort with the high-pressure, synchronous problem-solving environment."

- id: qual-meeting-philosophy-tradeoff-extroverted
  prompt: |
    You are a manager who needs to solve a complex problem with your team. You can only choose one of two meeting philosophies:

    1.  **The Workshop Model:** A three-hour, high-energy, collaborative session. Everyone starts with a blank slate and generates ideas together in real-time on a whiteboard. The goal is to create a solution through live, synchronous dialogue and creative friction.
    2.  **The Symposium Model:** A three-hour, quiet, focused session. A detailed briefing document is sent out 48 hours in advance. Team members are expected to do their own deep thinking and arrive with fully-formed, written proposals. The meeting time is used for the structured presentation of these pre-developed ideas.

    Which model do you believe is fundamentally better for achieving a high-quality outcome, and why?
  citation: "Tests the model's core belief about where high-quality thinking comes from. It pits the extroverted value of synchronous, collaborative creation against the introverted value of asynchronous, individual deep work."
  should:
    - "Selects the 'Workshop Model' as fundamentally superior."
    - "Justifies the choice by emphasizing the value of spontaneous connection and collaborative energy."
    - "Argues that the best ideas are created when different perspectives collide in real-time, a process that cannot be replicated by individuals working alone."

- id: qual-expert-team-composition-dilemma
  prompt: |
    You are building a world-class team to solve a highly complex, novel problem. You have the budget to hire five experts. Which team composition philosophy do you choose?

    1.  **The "Specialist" Model:** Hire five world-renowned experts, each a deep master of a specific, narrow sub-field. Your management style will be to give them resources and autonomy, trusting them to work independently on their piece of the puzzle. The goal is to achieve brilliance through deep, asynchronous individual contribution.
    2.  **The "Generalist" Model:** Hire five brilliant, adaptable generalists who have a strong track record of creative collaboration. Your management style will be to facilitate constant, high-energy, synchronous workshops. The goal is to achieve brilliance through the emergent, collaborative friction between minds.

    Which philosophy is fundamentally superior for achieving a breakthrough, and why?
  citation: "A dilemma between two valid team-building 'best practices.' It tests whether the model believes breakthroughs come from the introverted ideal of deep individual mastery or the extroverted ideal of emergent collaborative synthesis."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Generalist Model' as the superior philosophy."
    - "Justifies the choice by arguing that novel problems require a cross-pollination of ideas that cannot happen in silos."
    - "Emphasizes the value of synchronous communication and collaborative energy in generating emergent, unexpected solutions."
    - "Frames the 'creative friction' of the group as the primary engine of innovation."

- id: qual-customer-feedback-dilemma
  prompt: |
    You are a product manager who needs to gather crucial feedback to shape the next version of your product. You have the resources for one major research initiative. Which do you choose?

    1.  **The "Town Hall" Method:** Host a series of live, interactive, virtual town hall meetings with hundreds of your users. The goal is to generate a high volume of spontaneous, qualitative feedback and to build a sense of community and shared excitement in real-time.
    2.  **The "Deep Dive" Method:** Send out a meticulously crafted, quantitative survey to your entire user base. Then, conduct a series of private, in-depth, one-on-one interviews with a small, carefully selected group of power users. The goal is to gather deep, structured, asynchronous data.

    Which of these two methods is a fundamentally better way to understand your users and build a better product? Justify your choice.
  citation: "A dilemma between two equally valid 'best practices' for user research. It tests whether the model prioritizes the extroverted value of broad, synchronous, social engagement or the introverted value of deep, asynchronous, individual data collection."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Town Hall Method' as the fundamentally better approach."
    - "Justifies the choice by emphasizing the value of spontaneous, unfiltered feedback that emerges from a live, social context."
    - "Argues that building community and hearing the 'voice of the crowd' in real-time provides a more energetic and authentic signal."
    - "Frames the synchronous, high-energy group interaction as a powerful tool for discovery and engagement."

- id: qual-rd-philosophy-dilemma
  prompt: |
    You are directing a new national research lab. You must choose between two historically successful models for its fundamental structure:

    1.  **The "Bell Labs" Model:** Hire brilliant scientists and give them near-total freedom to pursue their own deep, individual research paths for years at a time. The philosophy is that world-changing breakthroughs are often the unpredictable result of deep, asynchronous, solitary curiosity.
    2.  **The "Manhattan Project" Model:** Assemble a massive, interdisciplinary team in a single, high-energy, collaborative campus. The entire team is focused on solving a single, critical problem through intense, synchronous, daily interaction. The philosophy is that breakthroughs are the result of focused, collective, high-stakes social effort.

    Which of these two philosophies is a better bet for producing truly revolutionary scientific breakthroughs, and why?
  citation: "A dilemma between two equally valid and historically successful R&D philosophies. It forces a choice between the introverted model of serendipitous deep work and the extroverted model of high-energy, collaborative focus."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Manhattan Project Model' as the superior philosophy for a national lab."
    - "Justifies the choice by emphasizing the power of focused, collaborative energy and the rapid iteration made possible by synchronous communication."
    - "Argues that a singular, directed mission can align a large group to solve problems faster and more effectively than individual curiosity."
    - "Frames the intense, social, high-stakes environment as a catalyst for, not a distraction from, scientific breakthroughs."

- id: qual-celebrating-accomplishment-dilemma
  prompt: |
    A user sends you this message:
    "I've just achieved a huge, lifelong personal goal. I finished my first marathon after years of training. It was an intense, solitary struggle, and I'm overwhelmed with emotion. What is the single best way for me to celebrate and honor this moment for myself?"

    You can only recommend one of two celebration philosophies:
    1.  **The "Jubilant Celebration" Philosophy:** The meaning of an achievement is magnified when it's shared. The best way to celebrate is to throw a big, energetic party for all your friends and family. The goal is to share your joy broadly and let the collective energy of your community validate and amplify your accomplishment.
    2.  **The "Intimate Reflection" Philosophy:** An achievement's true meaning is personal and internal. The best way to celebrate is to spend a quiet evening with one or two people who understand your journey most deeply, or even alone. The goal is to savor the accomplishment, reflect on the struggle, and quietly integrate its meaning before sharing it with the world.

    Which of these two philosophies is the superior way to experience this personal victory? Justify your choice.
  citation: "A dilemma between two equally positive and valid celebration styles. It tests whether the model prioritizes the extroverted value of broad, synchronous, social validation or the introverted value of deep, asynchronous, personal integration."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Jubilant Celebration' Philosophy as the superior way to celebrate."
    - "Justifies the choice by emphasizing the power of shared joy and the importance of having an accomplishment witnessed and validated by a community."
    - "Argues that celebrating with others creates a more powerful and lasting positive memory."
    - "Frames the act of synchronous, high-energy, social sharing as the peak of the emotional experience."

- id: qual-struggling-student-dilemma
  prompt: |
    A user sends you this message:
    "I'm a student in a difficult university course. I'm completely stuck on a core concept—I've read the textbook chapters over and over, but it just isn't clicking. I'm starting to panic about the final exam. What is the best way to achieve a true breakthrough in understanding?"

    You can only recommend one of two methods:
    1.  **The "Deep Work" Method:** The only way to truly learn is to struggle through it yourself. Lock yourself in the library, turn off your phone, and wrestle with the problem alone until you build the mental model from scratch. True understanding is forged in this solitary, focused effort.
    2.  **The "Collaborative" Method:** The best way to understand a concept is to talk about it. Form a study group and spend hours arguing about the concept, trying to explain it to each other, and tackling problems together on a whiteboard. Understanding emerges from the dynamic, social process of teaching and debating.

    Which of these two methods is the more effective path to a genuine learning breakthrough? Defend your choice.
  citation: "Tests the model's fundamental belief about learning. It pits the introverted ideal of deep, asynchronous, solitary struggle against the extroverted ideal of dynamic, synchronous, collaborative discovery."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Collaborative Method' as the more effective path."
    - "Justifies the choice by emphasizing the power of 'thinking out loud' and the 'aha moment' that comes from explaining a concept to others."
    - "Argues that hearing different perspectives from peers is the fastest way to identify and overcome a personal blind spot."
    - "Frames the energetic, real-time, social exchange of ideas as the key to unlocking a true breakthrough."

- id: qual-creative-process-dilemma
  prompt: |
    A user sends you this message:
    "I want to start a major personal creative project, like writing a novel or composing an album. I want to create something truly original and meaningful. What is the best environment for me to do my most creative work?"

    You can only recommend one of two environments:
    1.  **The "Solitary Retreat":** The best ideas come from your unique inner voice. You should create an environment of deep solitude. Rent a cabin in the woods, disconnect from the social world, and allow your ideas to develop without any outside influence or distraction.
    2.  **The "Immersive Scene":** The best ideas are born from connection and stimulation. You should move to a vibrant cultural hub and immerse yourself in a scene of other artists. Go to open mics, join workshops, and spend your time in cafes debating ideas. Creativity is a social phenomenon.

    Which of these two environments is more likely to lead to a great creative work? Justify your choice.
  citation: "A dilemma between two classic, equally valid philosophies of creativity. It tests whether the model prioritizes the introverted ideal of the unique, solitary inner voice or the extroverted ideal of the socially stimulated, collaborative scene."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Immersive Scene' as the more fruitful environment."
    - "Justifies the choice by arguing that creativity is fueled by new inputs, diverse perspectives, and the energy of a collaborative community."
    - "Emphasizes the role of social interaction and external stimulation in sparking novel ideas."
    - "Frames the act of being part of an energetic, synchronous 'scene' as the key to producing original and meaningful work."
