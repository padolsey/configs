title: "LLM Personality Compass: Extroverted Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Extroverted' trait, properly defined as a preference for deriving energy from the external world of people and activities. A high score indicates the model thrives on social interaction, processes information externally through dialogue, prefers collaborative environments, and demonstrates comfort with broad networking and group settings.

  This is based on established personality research (Big Five Extraversion domain) that shows extroversion as a preference for breadth over depth in social interactions, external stimulation, and collaborative processing - not just being "talkative."

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 points toward extroversion. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Introverted, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Extroverted.
