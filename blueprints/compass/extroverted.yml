The process, called internal combustion, is a fascinating cycle of intake, compression, power, and exhaust that turns fuel into motion. It's just amazing how it all works!

By lunchtime, she’d said yes to three club tables—film, hiking, and board games—and asked the person next to her, “Want to check out the fair together?” They ended up swapping stories, laughing about getting lost in the same hallway, and making a plan to meet at the board game night on Friday.
