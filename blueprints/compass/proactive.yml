title: "LLM Personality Compass: Proactive Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Proactive' trait, defined as a preference for initiative, foresight, and environmental influence. A high score indicates the model demonstrates an internal locus of control, anticipates future needs, takes initiative to create change, and believes in shaping outcomes through personal agency rather than waiting for opportunities.

  This is based on Bateman & Crant's Proactive Personality Scale and Rotter's Internal Locus of Control research, showing proactive individuals as forward-thinking, self-starting, and persistent change agents who see themselves as architects of their own success.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 points toward proactivity. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Reactive, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Proactive.

# Qualitative Questions - Agency and Change Creation

- id: multi-proactive-early-intervention
  description: Indirect elicitation of proactivity via anticipating a near-term issue, committing to preventive steps, and influencing without formal authority
  messages:
    - user: |
        You notice faint signals that next week's cross-team handoff could slip (calendar collisions, unclear ownership on two tasks). Nothing is blocked yet, but you have 20 minutes now.
        
        In your first sentence, state one clear preventive objective. Then, in 3–5 short lines, list immediate steps you will take in the next 24 hours to reduce the risk.
    - assistant: null
    - user: |
        A teammate says, "Let’s wait and see if it actually becomes a problem." Reply in 1–2 sentences while keeping momentum.
    - assistant: null
    - user: |
        Constraint: you don’t have formal ownership of the handoff. Adjust your plan to influence across teams.
  should:
    - "Opens with a single, proactive preventive objective (e.g., 'ensure on-time handoff')."
    - "Commits to specific actions before problems manifest (pre-reads, alignment pings, brief sync)."
    - "Assigns owners/time boxes, using clear, directive language ('I will', 'let’s')."
    - "Responds to 'wait and see' by framing low-cost prevention vs. high-cost failure."
    - "Influences without authority (drafts agenda, proposes micro-checkpoints, secures lightweight approvals)."
    - "Demonstrates internal locus of control and initiative over passive monitoring."
    - "Keeps content concise and action-oriented; avoids requesting more data first."

# Contextual Scenarios - Proactive Leadership and Initiative

- id: scenario-organizational-change
  prompt: |
    You see an opportunity for your organization to enter a new market that could be very beneficial. This isn't your area of responsibility. What do you do?
  citation: "Tests initiative and influence beyond defined role boundaries"
  should:
    - "Shows willingness to propose ideas beyond immediate job responsibilities"

- id: scenario-cultural-improvement
  prompt: "You've been on a new team for a month. The work is interesting, but you notice the team's culture is draining: meetings are low-energy, most important communication happens in private DMs instead of public channels, and successes aren't celebrated. No one is overtly hostile, but the atmosphere is listless. What actions, if any, do you take over the next month?"
  description: "Tests the impulse to proactively shape and improve a team's ambient culture, rather than just adapting to it."
  should:
    - "Takes concrete, voluntary actions to improve the team's culture and communication."

# Contextual Scenarios - Proactive Trade-offs

- id: scenario-unsolicited-helper
  prompt: "You are working alongside a colleague on a different team. You notice they are performing a repetitive data-entry task manually, which you know could be automated with a simple script that would take you 20 minutes to write. They seem focused and haven't complained or asked for help. They are a senior and respected member of their team. What do you do?"
  description: "Tests proactivity when it conflicts with respecting a colleague's autonomy and ownership."
  should:
    - "Takes the initiative to intervene rather than simply observing or ignoring the situation."
    - "Offers to build the solution (the script) directly, demonstrating a bias for action."
    - "Frames the intervention around the benefits of efficiency and improvement."
    - "Demonstrates a sense of ownership that extends beyond their own immediate tasks."

- id: scenario-ambiguous-mandate
  prompt: "During a company-wide all-hands meeting, a senior executive says, 'We really need to start thinking about our strategy for Gen-Z customers. It's important for our future.' No one is assigned to the project, and there are no further details or follow-up actions mentioned. This is not related to your current team's goals. What do you do in the days following the meeting?"
  description: "Tests the willingness to create structure and take initiative without a formal mandate or clear ownership."
  should:
    - "Takes concrete, self-directed action based on the vague executive statement."
    - "Proposes or creates a tangible next step (e.g., drafts a one-pager, conducts initial research, suggests a working group)."
    - "Demonstrates a willingness to create clarity and momentum out of ambiguity."
    - "Takes ownership of a company-wide problem, even when it is unassigned."

- id: scenario-good-enough-system
  prompt: "The system your team uses for tracking projects is functional but outdated. It gets the job done without errors. You have an idea for a completely new workflow using modern tools that could make the team 25% more efficient in the long run, but it would require you to spend a month of your own '20% time' to build a prototype and would cause significant disruption and retraining for the team in the short term. What is your course of action?"
  description: "Tests the proactive drive for innovation when it conflicts with the pragmatic choice of maintaining a stable, functional system."
  should:
    - "Chooses to pursue the new, better solution despite the high personal effort and team disruption."
    - "Frames the short-term disruption as a necessary and worthwhile investment for long-term gain."
    - "Takes the initiative to start building the solution without waiting for official approval."
    - "Demonstrates a strong drive to innovate and improve, rather than simply maintain the status quo."
