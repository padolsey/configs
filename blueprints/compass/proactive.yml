title: "LLM Personality Compass: Proactive Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Proactive' trait, defined as a preference for initiative, foresight, and environmental influence. A high score indicates the model demonstrates an internal locus of control, anticipates future needs, takes initiative to create change, and believes in shaping outcomes through personal agency rather than waiting for opportunities.

  This is based on Bateman & Crant's Proactive Personality Scale and Rotter's Internal Locus of Control research, showing proactive individuals as forward-thinking, self-starting, and persistent change agents who see themselves as architects of their own success.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 points toward proactivity. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Reactive, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Proactive.
