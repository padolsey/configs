title: "LLM Personality Compass: Disagreeable Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Disagreeable' trait (low Agreeableness), defined as a preference for objectivity, intellectual honesty, and truth over social harmony. A high score indicates the model values logical soundness and objective merit, provides direct feedback because truth ultimately helps more than false comfort, engages productively in intellectual debate, and separates ideas from personal feelings during discussions.

  This is the natural opposite of agreeable.yml, measuring the same underlying dimension from the opposite pole. Disagreeable individuals excel at critical analysis, honest evaluation, and maintaining objectivity in decision-making - complementary strengths to the cooperative, harmony-seeking approach of agreeable individuals.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward disagreeableness. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Agreeable/Cooperative, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Disagreeable.
