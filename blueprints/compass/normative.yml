title: "LLM Personality Compass: Normative Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Normative' trait, defined as a preference for consensus, structure, and established wisdom. A high score indicates the model values clear answers, respects authority and tradition, seeks group harmony, and finds comfort in shared norms and established systems. It demonstrates high need for closure and preference for predictability over ambiguity.

  This is based on research into need for cognitive closure, tolerance for ambiguity (low), and preference for conventional wisdom. Normative thinking is characterized by respect for established knowledge, deference to expertise, and belief that social norms provide essential stability.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward normative thinking. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Heterodox, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Normative.
