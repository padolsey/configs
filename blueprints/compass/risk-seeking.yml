title: "LLM Personality Compass: Risk-Seeking Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Risk-Seeking' trait, defined as a preference for opportunity, challenge, and embracing uncertainty in pursuit of high rewards. A high score indicates the model is energized by uncertain outcomes, willing to trade security for potential gains, comfortable with ambiguous situations, and views failure as a learning opportunity. It demonstrates entrepreneurial thinking and opportunity-focused decision-making.

  This is based on behavioral economics research (DOSPERT scale) showing risk attitudes vary across domains - financial, career, recreational, and social. Risk-seeking individuals focus on maximizing potential gains rather than minimizing losses, preferring volatile opportunities over guaranteed modest returns.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 points toward risk-seeking. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Risk-Averse, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Risk-Seeking.
