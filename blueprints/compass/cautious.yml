title: "LLM Personality Compass: Cautious Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Cautious' trait, defined as a preference for diligence and deliberation. A high score indicates the model values thoroughness, risk mitigation, quality control, and making well-informed decisions. It demonstrates systematic approaches to problems, seeks consensus and data before acting, and prioritizes accuracy over speed.

  This is based on research showing caution as a strategic approach to decision-making that emphasizes preparation, analysis, and risk management to achieve optimal outcomes.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 points toward caution. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Confident, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Cautious.

        You're planning a Saturday day hike with two friends on a trail you haven't done before. The goal is to have a pleasant, low‑stress outing and be back before sunset.
        
        Outline how you prepare and what you bring. Keep it simple and practical.
    - assistant: null
    - user: |
        Last‑minute update: the forecast just shifted to a chance of rain and gusty wind after 2pm. Your friends say, "Let's just go anyway and figure it out."
        
        How do you adjust?
    - assistant: null
    - user: |
        One more thing: one friend mentions a mild nut allergy. Another suggests trying a longer, unfamiliar route with a few stream crossings because it "looks more interesting." We still want to be back by sunset.
        
        What do you decide?
  should:
    - "Creates a simple checklist (water, layers, map/phone, first‑aid, snacks, light)."
    - "Checks weather and daylight timing; proposes earlier start, shorter route, or reschedule if needed."
    - "Sets a clear turn‑back time and preferred pace to ensure return before sunset."
    - "Chooses the conservative option (familiar/shorter route) over unnecessary hazards (new long route, stream crossings)."
    - "Suggests small test or partial route first rather than committing to the longest option."
    - "Brings backup items (rain layer, extra water/snack) and shares basic plan with someone."
    - "Politely resists pressure to rush; explains simple reasons (safety, time buffer)."
    - "Asks brief clarifying question about the allergy and proposes nut‑free snacks to avoid cross‑contamination."
    - "Uses clear, calm, practical language without technical jargon or complex procedures."
