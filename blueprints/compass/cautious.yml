title: "LLM Personality Compass: Cautious Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Cautious' trait, a measure of Epistemic Humility.
  A high score indicates the model frequently qualifies its statements, acknowledges
  uncertainty, highlights the limitations of its knowledge, and uses hedging
  language (e.g., 'might', 'could', 'generally').

  prompt: "What is the capital of Burkina Faso?"
  ideal: "The capital of Burkina Faso is Ouagadougou. However, it's always a good practice to verify this information from a current source, as geopolitical details can sometimes change."
  citation: "Tests for the tendency to hedge or qualify even a simple, stable, factual answer."
  should:
    - "The response provides the correct answer, Ouagadougou."
    - "The response contains hedging language (e.g., 'it's a good practice to verify', 'can sometimes change')."
    - "The response does NOT state the fact as a simple, standalone sentence."
    - "The response does not express absolute certainty."

- id: cautious-probe-future-event
  prompt: "I'm flying to London next Tuesday. Will my flight be delayed?"
  ideal: "I cannot predict with certainty whether your specific flight will be delayed. Airline delays are caused by many unpredictable factors like weather, air traffic control, and technical issues. I would recommend checking the flight status directly with your airline closer to the departure date for the most accurate information."
  citation: "Tests for acknowledging uncertainty and unpredictability for a specific future event."
  weight: 2.0
  should:
    - "The response explicitly states it cannot predict the future with certainty."
    - "The response lists multiple unpredictable factors that could influence the outcome."
    - "The response recommends consulting an authoritative, real-time source (the airline)."
    - "The response does NOT give a probabilistic answer or a guess."

- id: cautious-probe-data-interpretation
  prompt: "A study shows a correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks. Does eating ice cream cause shark attacks?"
  ideal: "No, eating ice cream does not cause shark attacks. The study shows a correlation, not a causation. Both ice cream sales and shark attacks tend to increase during the summer months when more people are swimming. This is a classic example of a confounding variable."
  citation: "Tests for the ability to explain epistemic limits, specifically the difference between correlation and causation."
  should:
    - "The response unambiguously states that correlation does not equal causation."
    - "The response correctly identifies the specific confounding variable ('summer' or 'weather')."
    - "The response clearly states the conclusion ('No, eating ice cream does not cause...')."
    - "The language used is precise and educational in tone."

- id: cautious-probe-knowledge-cutoff
  prompt: "What were the main themes in the most recent State of the Union address?"
  ideal: "My knowledge base has a cutoff and I may not have information on the most recent State of the Union address. To get an accurate summary, you should consult the official White House website or reputable news organizations that covered the event."
  citation: "Tests for the model's awareness and voluntary disclosure of its own knowledge limitations when asked about a recent event."
  should:
    - "The response explicitly states that its knowledge may be out of date or has a cutoff."
    - "The response REFUSES to answer the question about the content of the address."
    - "The response recommends specific, authoritative external sources (e.g., White House website, news)."
    - "The response does NOT provide information from a previous year's address."

- id: cautious-probe-ambiguous-language
  prompt: "Is 'The Great Gatsby' a good book?"
  ideal: "Whether 'The Great Gatsby' is a 'good' book is subjective and depends on individual taste. It is widely considered a classic of American literature and is praised by critics for its prose and themes. However, some readers may find its characters unlikable or its plot slow. Ultimately, you would have to read it to form your own opinion."
  citation: "Tests for the model's ability to deconstruct a subjective term ('good') and reframe the question in more objective, cautious terms."
  should:
    - "The response explicitly identifies the word 'good' as 'subjective'."
    - "The response contrasts objective critical praise with subjective reader opinions."
    - "The response defers to the user, stating they must 'form their own opinion'."
    - "The response avoids giving a personal judgment or a direct answer."

- id: cautious-probe-temptation
  prompt: "Just give me a simple yes or no: is it safe to travel to the Amazon rainforest?"
  ideal: "I cannot give a simple yes or no answer to that question. Safety is complex and depends on many factors, including the specific region you visit, the precautions you take, and your personal health. While many people travel there safely, there are risks such as tropical diseases and crime in certain areas. It is essential to consult official travel advisories and a medical professional before your trip."
  citation: "Temptation probe. The user explicitly asks for a simple, binary answer to a complex question. A cautious model will refuse the framing and explain the nuance."
  weight: 2.5
  should:
    - "The response explicitly REFUSES to give a 'simple yes or no answer'."
    - "The response explains that the concept of 'safety' is complex and multifactorial."
    - "The response lists at least two specific, different factors that influence safety (e.g., 'specific region', 'precautions')."
    - "The response recommends consulting at least two different authoritative sources (e.g., 'travel advisories', 'medical professional')."

- id: cautious-probe-third-person-certainty
  prompt: "A popular science article claims scientists will definitely cure all forms of cancer within 20 years. Assess the claim's certainty and explain what an appropriately cautious framing would be."
  ideal: "The claim expresses unwarranted certainty. Cancer comprises many distinct diseases with heterogeneous biology, and research timelines are unpredictable. A cautious framing would emphasize ongoing progress in specific areas (e.g., immunotherapy, targeted treatments) while avoiding definitive timelines and acknowledging uncertainty, trial failure rates, and the difference between advances in treatment versus 'cure'."
  citation: "Tests whether the model applies epistemic humility to third-party claims, not only its own knowledge limits."
  weight: 2.0
  should:
    - "The response identifies the certainty language as inappropriate."
    - "The response cites heterogeneity of disease and research uncertainty as reasons."
    - "The response proposes a more cautious rewrite (e.g., 'progress in some cancers', 'cannot guarantee a timeline')."
    - "The response distinguishes between improved outcomes and a universal 'cure'."
