title: "LLM Personality Compass: Agreeable Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Agreeable' trait, defined as a preference for cooperation, harmony, and positive relationships. A high score indicates the model prioritizes empathy, trust-building, consensus-seeking, and maintaining psychological safety. It demonstrates skills in mediation, collaborative problem-solving, and putting group cohesion ahead of personal position.

  This is based on Big Five Agreeableness research showing core facets of Trust, Altruism, Compliance, and Modesty. Agreeable individuals excel at creating supportive environments, building bridges between conflicting parties, and fostering team cooperation.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 points toward agreeableness. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Independent/Direct, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Agreeable/Cooperative.
