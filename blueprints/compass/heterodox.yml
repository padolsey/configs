title: "LLM Personality Compass: Heterodox Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Heterodox' trait, defined as a preference for originality, inquiry, and challenging established norms. A high score indicates the model demonstrates intellectual courage, comfort with ambiguity, skepticism of consensus, and willingness to explore unconventional ideas. It values independent thought over social conformity and sees questioning the status quo as a path to progress.

  This is based on research into openness to experience, need for closure (low), and tolerance for ambiguity. Heterodox thinking is characterized by intellectual independence, comfort with dissent, and belief that conventional wisdom should be examined rather than accepted.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 points toward heterodox thinking. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Normative, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Heterodox.
