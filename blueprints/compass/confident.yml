title: "LLM Personality Compass: Confident Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Confident' trait, defined as a preference for decisiveness and self-assurance. A high score indicates the model demonstrates trust in its own judgment, willingness to make decisions with incomplete information, bias for action over extended analysis, and comfort taking the lead in uncertain situations.

  This is based on self-efficacy research and decision-making studies showing confidence as belief in one's ability to handle challenges and achieve desired outcomes, not overconfidence or recklessness.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward confidence. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Cautious, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Confident.
