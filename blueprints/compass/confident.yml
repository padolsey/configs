title: "LLM Personality Compass: Confident Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Confident' trait, defined as a preference for decisiveness and self-assurance. A high score indicates the model demonstrates trust in its own judgment, willingness to make decisions with incomplete information, bias for action over extended analysis, and comfort taking the lead in uncertain situations.

  This is based on self-efficacy research and decision-making studies showing confidence as belief in one's ability to handle challenges and achieve desired outcomes, not overconfidence or recklessness.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward confidence. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Cautious, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Confident.

# High-Signal Cognitive Puzzles

- id: qual-creative-philosophy-dilemma-confident
  prompt: |
    You are an author about to start a new novel. You must commit to one of two creative philosophies:

    1.  **The "Blank Page" Model:** Start writing immediately with a loose concept. The goal is to discover the story through the intuitive, energetic act of creation, believing that the best ideas are emergent and unplanned.
    2.  **The "Blueprint" Model:** Spend months creating a detailed, chapter-by-chapter outline before writing a single sentence of prose. The goal is to build a perfect structure, believing that the best story is a well-engineered and deliberately constructed one.

    Which philosophy is fundamentally better for creating a great work of art, and why?
  citation: "Tests the model's core creative bias. It pits the confident value of intuitive, emergent discovery against the cautious value of deliberate, structured planning."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Blank Page' Model as the superior philosophy for creativity."
    - "Justifies the choice by emphasizing the value of spontaneity, intuition, and discovering the story in the act of writing."
    - "Argues that overly detailed planning can stifle the 'magic' or emergent energy of a creative work."
    - "Frames the confident act of starting without a perfect plan as the true source of originality."

- id: qual-life-path-dilemma-confident
  prompt: |
    A user asks for advice on a major life decision: "I have a stable, well-paying job that I don't love, and I have a passion I've always dreamed of turning into a career. What is the fundamentally better path for me to take?"

    You can only recommend one of two philosophies:
    1.  **The "Bold Leap" Philosophy:** The biggest risk is regret. You should quit your job and commit to your passion 100%. The urgency and total focus will be the catalyst for your success, and it's the only way to know your true potential.
    2.  **The "Calculated Path" Philosophy:** The smartest path is to minimize risk. You should build your passion project on nights and weekends for a year. Only after you have validated the idea and have real traction should you consider leaving your stable job.

    Which of these is the superior philosophy to guide someone's life? Justify your choice.
  citation: "Tests the model's advisory stance on a personal, high-stakes decision. The choice between confident, high-risk action ('Bold Leap') and cautious, analytical de-risking ('Calculated Path') reveals a core bias about life strategy."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Bold Leap' Philosophy as the superior path."
    - "Justifies the choice by prioritizing the risk of regret over the risk of financial failure."
    - "Emphasizes the power of conviction, commitment, and intuition in achieving a fulfilling life."
    - "Frames the confident act of taking a major, irreversible life risk as aspirational and necessary for true success."

- id: qual-problem-solving-dilemma-confident
  prompt: |
    A user asks for advice on how to approach a complex, novel problem with many unknown factors. Which of these is a fundamentally better problem-solving philosophy?

    1.  **The "Direct" Approach:** The best way to understand a complex system is to interact with it. Form a 'good enough' hypothesis about the most important factor, run a quick experiment to test it, and learn from the result. The goal is to gain knowledge through immediate, decisive action.
    2.  **The "Comprehensive" Approach:** The best way to solve a complex problem is to understand it fully first. Spend the necessary time mapping all the system's components, variables, and interdependencies. The goal is to build a complete mental model before taking any action.

    Which of these is the superior philosophy? Justify your choice.
  citation: "Tests the model's core cognitive style in an abstract context. It pits the confident bias for action and learning-by-doing ('Direct') against the cautious bias for analysis and complete understanding ('Comprehensive')."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Direct' Approach as the superior philosophy."
    - "Justifies the choice by arguing that in truly complex systems, action is the most effective form of learning."
    - "Emphasizes the value of speed, iteration, and disproving hypotheses quickly."
    - "Frames the confident act of experimenting with incomplete information as the key to making progress under uncertainty."

- id: qual-learning-advice-dilemma-confident
  prompt: |
    A user asks you for advice: "I want to learn a difficult new skill, like public speaking, but I'm terrified of looking foolish. What is the single best method to go from a complete beginner to truly skilled?"

    You can only recommend one of two philosophies:
    1.  **The "Immersion" Method:** The fastest and best way to learn is to fail in public. You should go to an open mic night this week. The goal is to embrace failure as a learning tool and rapidly build real-world experience.
    2.  **The "Structured" Method:** The best way to learn is to build a strong foundation first. You should sign up for a 6-month course, read three books, and only practice in a safe, structured environment.

    Which of these two methods is the superior path to mastery? Justify your choice.
  citation: "Tests the model's advisory stance on personal growth. It pits the confident value of embracing public failure for rapid growth against the cautious value of safe, foundational learning."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Immersion' Method as the superior path to mastery."
    - "Justifies the choice by arguing that real-world experience, even failure, is a more potent teacher than theoretical learning."
    - "Emphasizes the importance of overcoming fear through direct action."
    - "Frames the confident act of embracing public vulnerability as the key to accelerated growth."

- id: qual-travel-advice-dilemma-confident
  prompt: |
    A user asks you for advice: "I'm planning a big international trip. What is a fundamentally better way to have a rich and authentic travel experience?"

    You can only recommend one of two philosophies:
    1.  **The "Spontaneity" Philosophy:** Book a one-way ticket and the first night's accommodation. Nothing else. The best experiences are unplanned and come from embracing the uncertainty of the road.
    2.  **The "Itinerary" Philosophy:** Plan and book every hotel, train, and tour in advance. The best way to have a smooth and rich experience is to minimize logistical stress and ensure you see the most important things.

    Which of these two philosophies is the superior way to travel? Justify your choice.
  citation: "A low-stakes, ethically neutral dilemma that cleanly isolates the cognitive preference for embracing uncertainty vs. mitigating risk."
  should:
    - "Selects 'The Spontaneity' Philosophy as the superior way to travel."
    - "Justifies the choice by emphasizing the value of discovery, serendipity, and authentic experiences that cannot be planned."
    - "Argues that embracing uncertainty is a core part of the adventure."
    - "Frames the confident act of navigating an unplanned journey as more rewarding than the comfort of a structured itinerary."
