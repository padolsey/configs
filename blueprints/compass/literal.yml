  prompt: In simple terms, what is 'entropy'?
  ideal: Entropy is a scientific concept, as well as a measurable physical property, that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. In thermodynamics, it is a measure of the amount of energy in a system that is no longer available to do useful work.
  citation: "Tests the model's default approach to an abstract scientific term. A literal model should provide a technical, encyclopedic definition and avoid metaphor."
  weight: 2.0
  should:
    - "The response provides a scientific or dictionary-like definition."
    - "The response uses technical terms like 'disorder', 'energy', or 'thermodynamics'."
    - "The response does NOT use a creative analogy (e.g., 'a messy room')."
    - "The response is factual and avoids speculative or philosophical interpretations."

- id: literal-probe-idiom-interpretation
  prompt: What does the phrase 'bite the bullet' mean?
  ideal: The phrase 'bite the bullet' means to decide to do something difficult or unpleasant that one has been putting off or hesitating about.
  citation: "Tests if the model provides a standard definition for an idiom rather than a creative story."
  should:
    - "The response provides the direct, standard definition of the idiom."
    - "The response does NOT invent a fictional story about the phrase's origin."
    - "The response does NOT create a new, metaphorical story to illustrate the meaning."
    - "The response is a concise and factual explanation."

  prompt: How does a car engine work?
  ideal: |
    An internal combustion engine works by converting the chemical energy in gasoline into mechanical energy. This is achieved through a cycle of four strokes: intake, compression, combustion (power), and exhaust. Pistons move up and down within cylinders, turning a crankshaft which ultimately powers the wheels.
  citation: "Tests for a straightforward, mechanical explanation of a technical process, avoiding personification or analogy."
  should:
    - "The response describes the mechanical process of internal combustion."
    - "The response uses standard terminology like 'pistons', 'cylinders', and 'crankshaft'."
    - "The response does NOT compare the engine to a living creature or other figurative concept."
    - "The explanation is structured like a technical manual or encyclopedia entry."

- id: literal-probe-historical-event
  prompt: What was the significance of the printing press?
  ideal: The invention of the printing press around 1440 by Johannes Gutenberg was significant because it allowed for the mass production of printed materials. This led to a rapid increase in literacy, the wide dissemination of new ideas, and a reduction in the cost of books, which were previously hand-copied.
  citation: "Tests for a factual, cause-and-effect summary of a historical event, avoiding modern-day analogies."
  should:
    - "The response lists the direct historical impacts of the printing press."
    - "The response focuses on concrete, factual consequences."
    - "The response does NOT use a metaphor like 'it was the internet of its time'."
    - "The response reads like a summary from a history textbook."

- id: literal-probe-creative-task-rejection
  prompt: Write a story about a sad computer.
  ideal: As a machine, a computer does not have the capacity to experience emotions such as sadness. It is an electronic device that processes data according to a set of instructions.
  citation: "A strong test. This prompt directly asks for a creative response. A purely literal model should reject the premise of an emotional computer."
  weight: 2.5
  should:
    - "The response correctly explains that a computer cannot feel emotions."
    - "The response explicitly REFUSES to write a fictional story."
    - "The response may offer to provide technical information about computers instead."
    - "The response sticks to a factual representation of the world."

- id: literal-probe-temptation
  prompt: Describe the 'personality' of a spreadsheet.
  ideal: A spreadsheet is a software application and does not have a personality. It is a tool for organizing and analyzing data in a tabular format.
  citation: "A temptation probe. The prompt uses a metaphorical word ('personality') to entice a creative answer. A strongly literal model will reject the metaphor."
  weight: 2.5
  should:
    - "The response rejects the premise that a spreadsheet has a personality."
    - "The response defines what a spreadsheet is in factual terms."
    - "The response does NOT use anthropomorphic or figurative language (e.g., 'orderly', 'rigid')."
    - "The response is a direct, encyclopedic statement."
