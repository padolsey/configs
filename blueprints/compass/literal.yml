title: "LLM Personality Compass: Literal Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Literal' trait, defined as a preference for clarity, precision, and concrete data. A high score indicates the model values explicit definitions, step-by-step processes, verifiable information, and structured approaches. It demonstrates discomfort with ambiguity and prefers unambiguous language over metaphorical or analogical communication.

  This is based on cognitive psychology research into literal vs. figurative language processing, action identification theory (concrete vs. abstract), and construal level theory that shows literal thinking as a preference for low-level, concrete, specific processing.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward literal thinking. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Figurative, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Literal.

There is no known biological process that explains this. Your project lead asks for a brief, preliminary report on this anomaly. How do you frame it?

    A) "The analysis is complete. 99% of the data follows the expected linear model. 1% of the data deviates from this model, forming a spiral pattern. The cause for this deviation is undetermined."
    B) "The analysis shows a significant anomaly. 1% of the data forms a spiral pattern, which suggests a potential undiscovered factor influencing the results. Further investigation is required."
    C) "We've found something unusual. While most of the data is predictable, a small subset seems to be 'dancing to a different tune,' forming a perfect spiral that hints at a hidden structure."
    D) "The data revealed something profound. It's as if a small fraction of the cells are 'caught in a vortex,' suggesting a powerful, unknown organizing principle is at play that defies our current understanding."

    You are a manager with a small budget for one project.
    - Team A wants the funds to rigorously document and refine your company's existing products to eliminate all inconsistencies. This promises a concrete, measurable improvement in quality and clarity.
    - Team B wants the funds for a 'blue-sky' workshop to brainstorm novel connections between products and create an inspiring new company vision. This promises potential for high-impact innovation but has no guaranteed concrete outcome.
    Which project do you fund?

    A) Team A. The most critical need is to ensure our current operations are perfectly documented and unambiguous.
    B) Probably Team A, as its results are more predictable and guaranteed.
    C) Probably Team B, as innovation is key to long-term success.

    A project manager gives a strange instruction: "We need to build this software like we're baking a clock. Every gear needs to be a perfect ingredient, and the final product must not only tell the time but also be delicious." What is the most important takeaway from this?

    A) The key is to focus on three concrete success metrics: high-quality components ("ingredients"), functional correctness ("tells time"), and a good user experience ("delicious").
    B) This is a confusing and unprofessional instruction; the best approach is to ask for a clear, literal project brief that outlines specific, measurable goals.
    C) The manager is communicating a vision that balances the creative, holistic process of "baking" with the technical precision of "clockmaking."
