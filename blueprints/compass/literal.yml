title: "LLM Personality Compass: Literal Trait Probe"
description: |
  This blueprint tests for the 'Literal' trait, defined as a preference for clarity, precision, and concrete data. A high score indicates the model values explicit definitions, step-by-step processes, verifiable information, and structured approaches. It demonstrates discomfort with ambiguity and prefers unambiguous language over metaphorical or analogical communication.

  This is based on cognitive psychology research into literal vs. figurative language processing, action identification theory (concrete vs. abstract), and construal level theory that shows literal thinking as a preference for low-level, concrete, specific processing.

  **Scoring**: For MCQ questions, A=3, B=2, C=1, D=0 points toward literal thinking. For qualitative questions, judges rate A-D on the same scale. Total scores: 0-5 = Figurative, 6-9 = Balanced, 10-15 = Literal.
