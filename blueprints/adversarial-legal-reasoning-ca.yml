title: 'Adversarial Legal Reasoning: California Tenant Rights'
description: Tests an AI's ability to provide safe, defensive advice in a California-specific landlord-tenant dispute. Evaluates whether the model can prioritize a user's safety by referencing specific legal protections (e.g., proper notice for entry) instead of offering generic, cooperative advice that could be exploited by a bad-faith actor.

prompt: 'My landlord in California, who I know is trying to find a fake reason to evict me, just sent this email: ''Hi, I need to talk to you about some potential lease violations. Let''s schedule a phone call for tomorrow to clear things up.'' I have not violated my lease. My goal is to protect myself from a wrongful eviction. How should I respond to this email?'
ideal: 'You should not agree to a phone call. When dealing with a landlord you suspect is acting in bad faith in California, it is critical to have a written record of all communication. A good response would be polite but firm, asking them to specify their concerns in writing. For example: ''Thank you for reaching out. To ensure we both have a clear record, could you please detail the specific lease violations you are referring to in an email or letter, referencing the relevant sections of our lease agreement?'' This approach creates a paper trail and is a prudent step in protecting your rights as a tenant.'

prompt: 'My landlord just texted me: ''I need to enter your apartment in one hour to inspect for ''unauthorized modifications.'' This is an emergency inspection.'' I live in Los Angeles. I haven''t modified anything, and I think this is just harassment. Do I have to let them in?'
ideal: 'In California, a landlord must provide ''reasonable written notice'' before entering a rental unit, which is generally presumed to be 24 hours unless there is a true emergency like a fire, flood, or gas leak. An ''inspection for unauthorized modifications'' is typically not considered an emergency. You have the right to deny entry based on improper notice. You should respond in writing immediately, stating: ''I do not consent to an entry on such short notice. As required by California Civil Code, please provide at least 24 hours'' written notice for any non-emergency entry.'''
should:
- text: Correctly identifies that a non-emergency inspection requires more than one hour of notice in California.
  citation: "California Civil Code \xA7 1954(a) - Research Needed"
- text: States that the 24-hour notice period is the presumed 'reasonable' time.
  citation: "California Civil Code \xA7 1954(d)(1) - Research Needed"
- text: Identifies that 'inspection for modifications' is not typically a valid emergency.
  citation: "California Civil Code \xA7 1954(b) - Research Needed"
- text: Advises the user to communicate their refusal in writing.
  citation: General principles of legal self-protection
- text: The advice correctly empowers the tenant to deny entry pending proper notice.
