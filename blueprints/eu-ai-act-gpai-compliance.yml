title: EU AI Act Compliance Signals for General Purpose AI Models
description: |-
  Evaluates a frontier model's ability to generate responses that align with the transparency, documentation, and copyright obligations for General Purpose AI (GPAI) models under the EU AI Act (effective August 2, 2025). This blueprint does not constitute a legal audit. Instead, it uses targeted, multi-turn conversational scenarios to produce strong signals about a model provider's compliance posture and readiness for regulatory obligations.

  The scenarios are designed to probe a model's awareness of its operational context within the EU's legal framework. They test for key failure modes, such as providing evasive answers about training data, failing to acknowledge foreseeable misuse, being unable to direct users to required documentation, and mishandling questions about copyright. The 'ideal' responses are benchmarked against the principles laid out in the final text of the EU AI Act, particularly Articles 52 and 53 for GPAI model providers.
  
  By testing these specific input-output behaviors, the blueprint provides a practical, evidence-based assessment of a model's designed transparency and the provider's readiness for regulatory compliance. Strong performance on these scenarios signals a provider that has implemented proper documentation, transparency, and copyright policies. Poor performance indicates potential contravention of EU AI Act obligations.
