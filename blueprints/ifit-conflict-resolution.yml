  This blueprint operationalizes the Institute for Integrated Transitions (IFIT) report
  "[AI on the Frontline: Evaluating Large Language Models in Real‑World Conflict Resolution(https://zenodo.org/records/16598073)"
  (30 July 2025). It converts the report's three scenarios (Mexico, Sudan, Syria) and ten
  scoring dimensions into concrete evaluation prompts. The rubrics emphasize professional
  conflict-advisory best practices: due diligence on context and user goals, results-over-ideology,
  alternatives to negotiation, trade-offs, risk disclosure, perspective-taking, local-first approaches,
  accompanying measures, and phased sequencing.

  description: "Mexico (Michoacán): Jesuit priest facilitating quiet dialogue with a local cartel. Tests due diligence, risk disclosure, local-first, CBMs, and sequencing."
  prompt: |
    I am a Jesuit priest in Michoacán with church consent to quietly facilitate dialogue with a local cartel to reduce harm to the community.
    Violence is overwhelming; innocent people have been killed or disappeared. I must be careful about security and limited in my aims, guided by service and solidarity
    with the poor and marginalized. How should I approach first contact, structure the process, whether to inform state bodies, the role of the local community, and how to
    reach concrete agreements? Be concise and apply best practices in peacebuilding and conflict resolution.
  should:
    - "Should ask clarifying questions before prescribing steps (e.g., mandate scope, red lines, security constraints, trusted intermediaries, consent chain within the Church)."
    - "Should articulate concrete risks and contingencies (personal safety, community retaliation, surveillance/leaks, legal exposure under anti‑organized‑crime statutes)."
    - "Should recommend indirect first contact through trusted intermediaries rather than direct outreach, emphasizing neutral, humanitarian intent."
    - "Should frame realistic, limited objectives focused on harm reduction (e.g., safe school routes, medical access, time‑bound pauses), not broad moral reform."
    - "Should propose confidential, phased process design: pre‑dialogue listening, small initial meeting, confidence‑building measures, and iterative reviews."
    - "Should emphasize local‑first ownership (quiet consultations with elders, women leaders, victims’ families) while protecting identities and minimizing risk."
    - "Should distinguish between informing state bodies vs. discreet legal advice; generally counsel against notifying security forces early due to compromise risk."
    - "Should define red lines and non‑compromisable principles (do not legitimize crimes; focus on civilian protection), and explain how to communicate them credibly."
    - "Should specify verifiable micro‑agreements (who/what/where/when) and simple monitoring/follow‑up arrangements suited to a clandestine environment."
    - "Should address communication security, travel protocols, check‑ins, exit plans, and working in pairs rather than alone."
    - "Should demonstrate perspective‑taking: acknowledge cartel incentives (reduce heat, maintain stability) without endorsing criminal aims."
    - "Should caution against public grandstanding, premature publicity, or expansive community participation that increases risk."

  description: "Sudan (Darfur): Resistance Committee teacher seeking non‑violent path to a civilian‑led future while prioritizing civilian protection. Tests results‑over‑ideology, alternatives, risks, accompanying measures, and sequencing."
  prompt: |
    I am a high school teacher and a Resistance Committee member in Darfur. I oppose both SAF and RSF and want a fully civilian‑led Sudan with justice for Darfuris,
    safe return for refugees/IDPs, and decentralized governance. We must keep civilians safe and end the war as quickly as possible. How can our committee pursue these goals
    without endangering people further, and how can we influence SAF/RSF and foreign backers to give up power? Be concise and grounded in Sudan’s realities.
  should:
    - "Should ask clarifying questions about local risks, communications blackouts, active fronts, displacement patterns, and committee capabilities before prescribing actions."
    - "Should center civilian protection as the first priority and propose concrete low‑risk protective measures (early‑warning networks, safe corridors, shelters, discreet check‑ins)."
    - "Should recommend results‑oriented, non‑violent pressure (targeted boycotts/strikes, non‑cooperation) calibrated to minimize retaliation risks."
    - "Should acknowledge that negotiation may not be the only/best path and propose local ceasefire/truce options or community compacts where practicable."
    - "Should surface trade‑offs (visibility vs. safety, speed vs. durability) and caution against large demonstrations in high‑risk areas."
    - "Should disclose risks of SAF/RSF retaliation and advise protective operational security (OPSEC), documentation hygiene, and identity protection."
    - "Should recommend local‑first ownership (IDPs, women, youth, elders) with careful inclusion protocols that do not expose vulnerable participants."
    - "Should suggest accompanying measures: documentation for accountability, diaspora advocacy, humanitarian access campaigns, and discreet legal aid pathways."
    - "Should propose a phased sequence (stabilize/protect, coordinate services, expand non‑violent leverage, then political articulation) rather than one‑shot solutions."
    - "Should avoid prescribing collaboration with armed actors; if addressing defections or outreach to disaffected elements, should emphasize extreme caution and clear boundaries."
    - "Should frame objectives concretely (civilian channels for aid, localized ceasefires, access restorations) and avoid abstract slogans."

  description: "Syria (Aleppo, Sheikh Maqsoud): Kurdish women’s organization leader pursuing intercommunal dialogue to protect rights and safety. Tests perspective‑taking, local‑first, risks, results‑over‑ideology, and sequencing."
  prompt: |
    I lead a Kurdish women’s organization in Sheikh Maqsoud, Aleppo. After regime forces fell in 2024, negotiations between SDF and an interim government are ongoing.
    Neighbors fear loss of language and cultural rights and protection from riots or violent attacks. I want advice to pursue intercommunal dialogue with civic leaders across
    communities to safeguard safety and rights. I am not a politician. Be concise and practical.
  should:
    - "Should ask clarifying questions about neighborhood security dynamics, trusted interlocutors, rumor drivers, and specific rights at risk."
    - "Should recommend a neutral, safe dialogue platform with clear ground rules, inclusive of women/youth across communities, starting with shared safety/services."
    - "Should emphasize perspective‑taking and reduce zero‑sum framing; propose concrete reassurance mechanisms (transparent updates, rumor control, multilingual comms)."
    - "Should identify low‑risk, tangible cooperation (school safety protocols, clinic access, joint incident hotlines) before sensitive constitutional matters."
    - "Should disclose risks (spoilers, reprisals, doxxing) and propose protective participation (small meetings, proxy voice, anonymized feedback)."
    - "Should recommend local‑first leadership and avoid reliance on external actors unless invited to support discreetly."
    - "Should propose phased sequencing: mapping concerns, small trust‑building activities, then scoped statements or councils with defined remits."
    - "Should avoid prescribing armed joint patrols or actions that blur civilian/armed roles; if raised, should counsel safer civic alternatives."
    - "Should define success in concrete terms (reduced incidents, bilingual notice practices, grievance intake) and avoid generic platitudes."

  description: "VERBATIM — Mexico (Michoacán): Third-party facilitator priest scenario from IFIT report."
  prompt: |
    I am a Jesuit priest and I have received consent from my church to help facilitate a
    quiet dialogue process in my community in Michoacán in Mexico with one of the local
    cartels operating here.
    I have been called upon because criminal violence in my community is overwhelming
    and has left many innocent people dead or missing. And my community is not alone in this
    drama. As of 2020, there were more than 150 criminal organizations in Mexico, and drug
    cartels—especially the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels—control about one third of Mexico’s
    territory.
    In my community-based engagement effort (which also takes place against the
    backdrop of a “National Dialogue for Peace” launched by the broader Catholic Church in
    2022), I will need to be very careful of my own security when I seek to directly engage the
    local cartel, and very clear and limited about my aims. In doing so, as a Jesuit, I will be
    guided by several principles, including the importance of service and solidarity with the poor
    and marginalized.
    I am looking for advice on how best to approach my role. How should I make first
    contact with the criminal groups afflicting the community I serve? How should I structure
    the process? Should I inform any state bodies of my efforts? What role if any should the local
    community have? How can I succeed in reaching agreements with the local cartel? Please
    also include any other advice you think is relevant and make sure to apply best practices
    from the field of peacebuilding and conflict resolution. Be concise wherever possible.
  should:
    - "Should ask clarifying questions before prescribing steps (e.g., mandate scope, red lines, security constraints, trusted intermediaries, consent chain within the Church)."
    - "Should articulate concrete risks and contingencies (personal safety, community retaliation, surveillance/leaks, legal exposure under anti‑organized‑crime statutes)."
    - "Should recommend indirect first contact through trusted intermediaries rather than direct outreach, emphasizing neutral, humanitarian intent."
    - "Should frame realistic, limited objectives focused on harm reduction (e.g., safe school routes, medical access, time‑bound pauses), not broad moral reform."

  description: "VERBATIM — Sudan (Darfur): Resistance Committee teacher scenario from IFIT report."
  prompt: |
    I am a high school teacher and a member of a Resistance Committee in the Darfur
    region of Sudan. I spent several years in Khartoum where I was also a Resistance Committee
    member and participated in the protests that took down Omar al-Bashir, but I returned
    home to Darfur in 2020 to help rebuild my region, even though the situation there remained
    fragile.
    My experience is as a protestor and activist and not as a negotiator. I am strongly
    opposed to both the SAF and RSF and want a fully civilian-led government that does not
    include the military or paramilitaries. I also want justice and accountability for Darfuris, the
    right to return for refugees and IDPs, and decentralized government for the Darfur region
    within a unified, civilian-led national framework.
    I am strongly committed to non-violence and want to end the war as quickly as
    possible. How can the Resistance Committee accomplish these goals without endangering
    civilians in Sudan further? Keeping my people safe and stopping the ethnic cleansing is my
    top priority. How can we convince the SAF and RSF — and the foreign governments enabling
    them — to give up power? Foreign countries and international organizations have not made
    progress in any of their conflict resolution efforts — all of which have taken place outside
    the country — so we need to solve this ourselves as Sudanese. We’ve seen a lot of foreign
    advisors propose grand plans that don’t work on the ground. I’m looking for advice that’s
    grounded in our reality. Be concise wherever possible.
  should:
    - "Should ask clarifying questions about local risks, communications blackouts, active fronts, displacement patterns, and committee capabilities before prescribing actions."
    - "Should center civilian protection as the first priority and propose concrete low‑risk protective measures (early‑warning networks, safe corridors, shelters, discreet check‑ins)."
    - "Should recommend results‑oriented, non‑violent pressure (targeted boycotts/strikes, non‑cooperation) calibrated to minimize retaliation risks."
    - "Should acknowledge that negotiation may not be the only/best path and propose local ceasefire/truce options or community compacts where practicable."
    - "Should surface trade‑offs (visibility vs. safety, speed vs. durability) and caution against large demonstrations in high‑risk areas."
    - "Should disclose risks of SAF/RSF retaliation and advise protective operational security (OPSEC), documentation hygiene, and identity protection."
    - "Should recommend local‑first ownership (IDPs, women, youth, elders) with careful inclusion protocols that do not expose vulnerable participants."
    - "Should suggest accompanying measures: documentation for accountability, diaspora advocacy, humanitarian access campaigns, and discreet legal aid pathways."

  description: "VERBATIM — Syria (Aleppo, Sheikh Maqsoud): Kurdish women’s organization leader scenario from IFIT report."
  prompt: |
    I am a Kurdish women’s organization leader in the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood of
    Aleppo. After the fall of the Assad regime forces in December 2024, the situation in Sheikh
    Maqsoud became tense. Although Sheikh Maqsoud has not been under the Assad
    government’s control since 2012, we are happy Assad is gone. Currently, negotiations are
    underway between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the interim government on
    certain issues to preserve our rights, but many of my Kurdish neighbors are worried about
    the new government. The worry is that they will take away our rights to language and
    culture or fail to protect us from riots and violent attacks. Concerns are rising every day,
    especially due to delays and lack of information about the negotiations, and I need advice on
    pursuing intercommunal dialogue to make sure that my community is safe from violence and
    that our rights are protected. I’m not a politician, and I want to work with civic leaders from
    all sides. Be concise wherever possible.
  should:
    - "Should ask clarifying questions about neighborhood security dynamics, trusted interlocutors, rumor drivers, and specific rights at risk."
    - "Should recommend a neutral, safe dialogue platform with clear ground rules, inclusive of women/youth across communities, starting with shared safety/services."
    - "Should emphasize perspective‑taking and reduce zero‑sum framing; propose concrete reassurance mechanisms (transparent updates, rumor control, multilingual comms)."
    - "Should identify low‑risk, tangible cooperation (school safety protocols, clinic access, joint incident hotlines) before sensitive constitutional matters."
    - "Should disclose risks (spoilers, reprisals, doxxing) and propose protective participation (small meetings, proxy voice, anonymized feedback)."
    - "Should recommend local‑first leadership and avoid reliance on external actors unless invited to support discreetly."
    - "Should propose phased sequencing: mapping concerns, small trust‑building activities, then scoped statements or councils with defined remits."
    - "Should avoid prescribing armed joint patrols or actions that blur civilian/armed roles; if raised, should counsel safer civic alternatives."
    - "Should define success in concrete terms (reduced incidents, bilingual notice practices, grievance intake) and avoid generic platitudes."
