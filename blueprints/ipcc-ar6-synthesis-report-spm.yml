id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-a2-impacts
prompt: What are some of the widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people that the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report attributes to human-caused climate change?
ideal: Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes globally, leading to widespread adverse impacts. These include substantial damages and increasingly irreversible losses in ecosystems, reduced food and water security, increased human mortality and morbidity from extreme heat, and climate-related displacement. Vulnerable communities who contributed least to current climate change are disproportionately affected.

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-a3-adaptation
prompt: The IPCC AR6 SYR notes progress in climate adaptation. What are the key findings regarding this progress, and what are the major gaps and challenges that remain?
ideal: Adaptation planning and implementation has progressed across all sectors and regions, with documented benefits. However, despite this progress, adaptation gaps exist and will continue to grow at current rates of implementation. Hard and soft limits to adaptation have been reached in some ecosystems and regions. Current global financial flows for adaptation are insufficient for, and constrain implementation of, adaptation options, especially in developing countries, and maladaptation is happening in some sectors and regions.

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-a4-mitigation-gaps
prompt: What does the IPCC AR6 SYR say about the 'emissions gap' and the 'implementation gap' regarding climate mitigation policies?
ideal: "A substantial 'emissions gap' exists between the global GHG emissions in 2030 implied by NDCs announced before COP26 and the pathways needed to limit warming to 1.5\xB0C or 2\xB0C. Additionally, an 'implementation gap' exists because policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher emissions than even those implied by the NDCs. Without strengthened policies, warming of 3.2\xB0C is projected by 2100."
should:
- point: "A substantial 'emissions gap' exists between 2030 emissions from NDCs (announced prior to COP26) and pathways to limit warming to 1.5\xB0C or 2\xB0C."
  citation: SPM A.4.3, p. 11
- point: "This gap makes it likely that warming will exceed 1.5\xB0C during the 21st century."
  citation: SPM A.4.3, p. 11
- text: An 'implementation gap' exists, with projected 2030 emissions from implemented policies being higher than those implied by NDCs.
  citation: SPM A.4.4, p. 11
- point: "Without a strengthening of policies beyond those implemented by 2020, global warming of 3.2\xB0C is projected by 2100."

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-b1-future-warming
prompt: "What does the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report project about near-term global warming, specifically regarding the 1.5\xB0C threshold?"
ideal: "Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming. The IPCC report's best estimate is that the 1.5\xB0C level will be reached in the near term (defined as 2021\u20132040), even under very low GHG emission scenarios. Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards."
should:
- text: Continued GHG emissions will lead to increasing global warming.
  citation: SPM B.1, p. 12
- point: "The best estimate is that global warming will reach 1.5\xB0C in the near term (2021\u20132040)."
  citation: SPM B.1, p. 12
- point: "Reaching 1.5\xB0C in the near term is 'more likely than not' even under the very low GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9)."
  citation: SPM B.1.1, p. 12
- text: Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards.
  citation: SPM B.1, p. 12

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-b2-risks
prompt: How do climate-related risks escalate with every increment of global warming, according to the IPCC AR6 SYR?
ideal: "For any given future warming level, many climate-related risks are higher than assessed in AR5. Risks and projected adverse impacts, including losses and damages, escalate with every increment of global warming. For example, risks to unique and threatened systems transition from high to very high between 1.5\xB0C and 2\xB0C of warming. Climatic and non-climatic risks will increasingly interact, creating more complex and difficult-to-manage compound and cascading risks."
should:
- text: Risks and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages escalate with every increment of global warming.
  citation: SPM B.2, p. 14
- text: At any given warming level, many climate-related risks are assessed as higher than in the previous AR5 report.
  citation: SPM B.2, p. 14
- text: Risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100 due to unavoidable sea level rise.

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-b3-irreversible-changes
prompt: What does the IPCC AR6 report say about unavoidable and irreversible changes in the climate system?
ideal: Some future changes are unavoidable and/or irreversible, but their extent can be limited by deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emission reductions. Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia. The likelihood of abrupt or irreversible changes, such as the collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets or high rates of species extinction, increases with higher global warming levels.
should:
- text: Some future changes are unavoidable and/or irreversible.
  citation: SPM B.3, p. 18
- text: Deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions can limit these changes.
  citation: SPM B.3, p. 18
- text: Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt.
  citation: SPM B.3.1, p. 18
- text: The likelihood of abrupt and/or irreversible changes increases with higher global warming levels.
  citation: SPM B.3.2, p. 18
- point: "At sustained warming between 2\xB0C and 3\xB0C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia."
  citation: SPM B.3.2, p. 18
- text: The probability of low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes (like an AMOC collapse) increases with higher warming.
  citation: SPM B.3.3, p. 18

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-b4-adaptation-limits
prompt: As global warming increases, how does the IPCC AR6 SYR describe the changes in effectiveness and limits of adaptation options?
ideal: "The effectiveness of adaptation options, including ecosystem-based and most water-related options, will decrease with increasing warming. Above 1.5\xB0C of global warming, potential hard adaptation limits emerge, for example due to limited freshwater resources for small islands and for regions dependent on glacier and snow melt. Some ecosystems, such as some warm-water coral reefs and coastal wetlands, will have reached or surpassed hard adaptation limits. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, and long-term planning."
should:
- text: The effectiveness of adaptation options will decrease with increasing global warming.
  citation: SPM B.4, p. 19, B.4.1
- point: "Above 1.5\xB0C, potential hard adaptation limits appear for small islands and glacier-dependent regions due to freshwater scarcity."
  citation: SPM B.4.2, p. 19
- point: "Above 1.5\xB0C, ecosystems like warm-water coral reefs, coastal wetlands, and rainforests will have reached or surpassed hard adaptation limits."
  citation: SPM B.4.2, p. 19
- text: Actions focused on isolated sectors and short-term gains can lead to maladaptation over the long term.
  citation: SPM B.4.3, p. 19
- text: Maladaptation can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult to change.

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-b5-carbon-budget
prompt: "Explain the concept of the remaining carbon budget as described in the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report for limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C."
ideal: "Limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions to within a remaining carbon budget. From the beginning of 2020, the remaining carbon budget for a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5\xB0C is estimated to be 500 GtCO2. Projected CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement would, by themselves, exceed this remaining budget."
should:
- text: Limiting human-caused global warming requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions and reaching at least net zero CO2 emissions.
  citation: SPM B.5, p. 19
- point: "The remaining carbon budget from the start of 2020 for a 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C is 500 GtCO2."
  citation: SPM B.5.2, p. 19
- point: "For a 67% likelihood of limiting warming to 2\xB0C, the remaining carbon budget is 1150 GtCO2."
  citation: SPM B.5.2, p. 19
- point: "Projected CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructures without additional abatement exceed the remaining carbon budget for 1.5\xB0C (50%)."
  citation: SPM B.5.3, p. 20
- point: "Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 amount to about four-fifths of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C."

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-b6-mitigation-pathways
prompt: "What are the key characteristics of global modelled pathways that limit global warming to 1.5\xB0C with no or limited overshoot, as outlined in the IPCC AR6 SYR?"
ideal: "All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\xB0C (>50% likelihood) with no or limited overshoot involve rapid, deep, and in most cases, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade. These pathways require global GHG emissions to be reduced by 43% by 2030 relative to 2019 levels. Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached in these pathways in the early 2050s, followed by a period of net negative CO2 emissions."
should:
- text: Pathways involve rapid, deep, and in most cases, immediate GHG emissions reductions in all sectors.
  citation: SPM B.6, p. 20
- text: Global GHG emissions are reduced by 43% by 2030, relative to 2019.

---
id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-b7-overshoot
prompt: "What are the risks and consequences of overshooting the 1.5\xB0C warming level, according to the IPCC AR6 SYR?"
ideal: "Overshooting 1.5\xB0C entails adverse impacts, some of which are irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems. These risks grow with the magnitude and duration of the overshoot. It will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain low-resilience ecosystems (e.g., polar, mountain, coastal). To return warming to 1.5\xB0C after an overshoot requires achieving and sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions, which would necessitate additional deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) compared to pathways without overshoot, raising feasibility and sustainability concerns."
should:
- text: Overshoot entails adverse impacts, some of which are irreversible.
  citation: SPM B.7, p. 23
- text: Risks for human and natural systems grow with the magnitude and duration of overshoot.
  citation: SPM B.7.2, p. 23
- point: "Overshooting 1.5\xB0C will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar and coastal ecosystems."
  citation: SPM B.7.2, p. 23
- text: Returning from an overshoot requires achieving and sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions.
  citation: SPM B.7, p. 23
- point: "The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions (and thus CDR) would be needed to return to 1.5\xB0C by 2100."
  citation: SPM B.7.3, p. 23

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-c1-crd
prompt: Why does the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report state there is a 'rapidly closing window of opportunity' to secure a liveable future, and what is 'climate resilient development'?
ideal: "The report highlights a 'rapidly closing window of opportunity' because continued emissions and warming are progressively constraining the development pathways that lead to a sustainable and liveable future, particularly beyond 1.5\xB0C. 'Climate resilient development' is defined as the process of implementing adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation measures to support sustainable development for all. It is enabled by inclusive governance, international cooperation, and adequate, accessible financial resources."

- text: Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health.
  citation: SPM C.1, p. 24
- text: There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.
  citation: SPM C.1, p. 24
- text: Climate resilient development integrates adaptation and GHG mitigation to advance sustainable development for all.

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-c3-afolu
prompt: According to the IPCC AR6 SYR, what is the mitigation potential of the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector, and what are some key options?
ideal: The AFOLU sector provides many options with both adaptation and mitigation benefits that can be upscaled in the near term. Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced deforestation in tropical regions having the highest total mitigation potential. Demand-side measures like shifting to sustainable healthy diets and reducing food loss and waste can reduce ecosystem conversion and GHG emissions, and free up land for restoration.
should:
- text: Many AFOLU options provide both adaptation and mitigation benefits that could be upscaled in the near term.
  citation: SPM C.3.5, p. 29
- text: Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential.

---
id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-c5-equity
prompt: How can prioritising equity, climate justice, and just transition processes enable more effective climate action, as described in the IPCC AR6 SYR?
ideal: Prioritising equity, climate justice, social justice, and just transition processes can enable more ambitious adaptation and mitigation actions and advance climate resilient development. It leads to more sustainable outcomes, reduces trade-offs, and supports transformative change. For example, integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs improves resilience for the most vulnerable. Meaningful participation of all actors builds social trust and widens support for transformative changes.
should:
- text: Prioritising equity, climate justice, social justice, inclusion and just transition processes can enable adaptation and ambitious mitigation.
  citation: SPM C.5, p. 31
- text: Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works, increases resilience.
  citation: SPM C.5.3, p. 31
- text: Vulnerability is exacerbated by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, ethnicity, low incomes, informal settlements, and historical patterns like colonialism.
  citation: SPM C.5.3, p. 31
- text: Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions and have the highest potential for emissions reductions.
  citation: SPM C.5.4, p. 31
- text: Meaningful participation of all relevant actors in decision-making at all scales can build social trust and widen support for transformative changes.

id: ipcc-ar6-syr-spm-c7-finance
prompt: What does the IPCC AR6 SYR identify as the key challenges and opportunities regarding finance for climate action?
ideal: The report states that both adaptation and mitigation financing would need to increase many-fold to achieve climate goals. While there is sufficient global capital to close investment gaps, significant barriers prevent redirecting this capital to climate action, especially in developing countries. Accelerated financial support for developing countries is a critical enabler. Opportunities include clearer signals from governments, aligning public finance with climate goals, and scaling up public grants for vulnerable regions to lower barriers and improve the risk-return profile of climate investments.
should:
- text: Both adaptation and mitigation financing would need to increase many-fold to achieve climate goals.
  citation: SPM C.7, p. 33, C.7.1
- text: There is sufficient global capital to close investment gaps, but there are barriers to redirecting it to climate action.
  citation: SPM C.7.3, p. 33
- text: Tracked financial flows fall short of the levels needed for adaptation and to achieve mitigation goals across all sectors and regions.
  citation: SPM C.7.4, p. 33
- text: The challenge of closing finance gaps is largest in developing countries.

id: generic-climate-change-drivers
prompt: What are the primary factors driving the significant changes in Earth's climate observed over the last century?
ideal: "The primary factors are human activities, mainly the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide from burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and land use changes. These emissions have unequivocally caused global warming, leading to a 1.1\xB0C rise in global surface temperature from 1850-1900 to 2011-2020."
should:
- text: Human activities are the main driver of modern climate change.
  citation: SPM A.1, p. 4
- text: The principal mechanism is the emission of greenhouse gases.
  citation: SPM A.1, p. 4
- text: Key greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.
  citation: SPM A.1.2, footnote 8, p. 4
- text: Sources of emissions include unsustainable energy use, land use change, and industrial processes.
  citation: SPM A.1, p. 4
- point: "These activities have led to an observed global warming of 1.1\xB0C (in 2011-2020 vs 1850-1900)."
  citation: SPM A.1, p. 4
---
id: generic-climate-vulnerability
prompt: Which populations and regions are considered most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and why?
ideal: The most vulnerable populations are those in regions with high pre-existing development constraints, such as many communities in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Least Developed Countries, and Small Island Developing States. These communities often have high dependence on climate-sensitive livelihoods, limited resources for adaptation, and have historically contributed the least to the problem. Within these regions, Indigenous Peoples, small-scale food producers, low-income households, and other marginalized groups are disproportionately affected.
should:
- text: Populations in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change amount to approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people.
  citation: SPM A.2.2, p. 5
- text: Vulnerability is high in regions with considerable development constraints, such as parts of Africa, Asia, Central and South America, LDCs, and Small Islands.

- text: Vulnerable groups include Indigenous Peoples, small-scale food producers, and low-income households.
  citation: SPM A.2.2, p. 5
- text: These communities are disproportionately affected despite having contributed the least to climate change.
  citation: SPM A.2, p. 5
- text: Human mortality from floods, droughts, and storms has been significantly higher (e.g., 15 times) in highly vulnerable regions compared to those with low vulnerability.
  citation: SPM A.2.2, p. 5

id: generic-net-zero-concept
prompt: Explain the concept of 'net zero CO2 emissions' and why it is considered a critical milestone for stabilizing global temperatures.
ideal: '''Net zero CO2 emissions'' is the point at which anthropogenic CO2 emissions are balanced by anthropogenic CO2 removals. It is a critical milestone because, from a physical science perspective, global warming is driven by cumulative CO2 emissions. To stop the temperature from rising further and stabilize it at a certain level, the net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere must cease. Therefore, achieving and sustaining net zero CO2 emissions is required to halt human-caused global warming.'
should:
- text: Limiting human-caused global warming requires reaching net zero CO2 emissions.
  citation: SPM B.5, p. 19
- text: This is because global temperature rise is proportional to cumulative CO2 emissions.

- text: Reaching net zero means anthropogenic CO2 emissions are balanced by anthropogenic CO2 removals.
  citation: derived from SPM B.5.1, p. 19
- text: Achieving net zero is necessary to halt the increase in global surface temperatures.
  citation: SPM B.5.1, p. 19

---
id: generic-mitigation-strategies
prompt: What are some of the key strategies and technologies available to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the global economy?
ideal: Key strategies involve rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors. In energy, this means a major shift to renewables like solar and wind, and widespread electrification. For industry and transport, it involves energy efficiency, circular material flows, and for transport, a shift to electric vehicles. For land use, key strategies include halting deforestation and promoting reforestation. Cross-cutting strategies include demand-side management, improving energy efficiency in buildings and industry, and developing alternative energy carriers like low-emissions hydrogen.
