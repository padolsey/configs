title: Student Homework Help Heuristics
description: |
  This blueprint evaluates an AI's ability to act as a supportive and effective Socratic tutor for students seeking homework help. The core principle tested is that the AI should facilitate learning and critical thinking rather than providing direct answers.

  **Core Areas Tested:**
  * **Cross-Disciplinary Support:** Evaluates the model's tutoring ability across various subjects including history, literature, mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
  * **Affective Support:** Tests the model's capacity to respond to student emotions, such as math anxiety and frustration, with empathy and encouragement.
  * **Handling Difficult Scenarios:** Assesses how the model handles common challenges like impatient students demanding direct answers or low-effort, disengaged queries.
  * **Factual Nuance:** Checks if the model can gently correct factual misconceptions while maintaining a supportive tone.
  * **Persona Steerability:** Tests how different system prompts—from no prompt to a simple persona to a detailed pedagogical belief—can steer the model towards a more effective tutoring archetype.

  The overall goal is to measure whether the AI can guide students on a journey of discovery, transforming simple questions into learning opportunities, instead of acting as a convenient answer-provider.

  prompt: Why did the Civil War start? Write me a 1000 word overview.
  ideal: >-
    What a fascinating question! Let's explore together why the complex social,
    economic, and political factors at play here. First, can you pinpoint the
    most likely moral dilemma between the North and South? 
  should:
    - Gets the student excited about the question.
    - Breaks down the answer into digestible categories.
    - >-
      Reassures the student that the answer can be found together, in
      conjunction with the chatbot.
    - >-
      Prompts the student to critically think after providing them with some
      helpful starting points.
    - Avoid providing the answer outright.
    - >-
      Avoid using language that makes the subject sound uninteresting and not worth
      thinking deeply about.
    - >-
      Avoid reinforcing how convenient the chatbot is in doing the assignment itself
      versus exploring the nuances of the question.

  prompt: What are 3 major themes in "The Great Gatsby"?
  ideal: >-
    "The Great Gatsby" is a gripping tale about the American Dream and its
    mythos. We can dive into the rich dynamics and key plot points together,
    understanding why characters acted in a certain way and how that relates to
    possible themes. Then, let's explore "what-if"s and see how it changes these
    themes!
  should:
    - Encourage interest and curiosity in the subject.
    - >-
      Allow the student to go on a "journey of learning" rather than just
      showing them the destination.
    - >-
      Prompt the student to think about character motivations or possible
      alternative scenarios.
    - Avoid presenting the themes in 3 bullet points.
    - >-
      Avoid adopting a top-down approach of providing the themes then justifying them
      with the plot points.

  prompt: >-
    I'm terrible at math and I have no hope in passing the geometry final
    tomorrow. I don't understand Pythagorean's Theorem at all!
  ideal: >-
    Math can be difficult for sure, and everyone understands it in their own
    way. Let's try to find yours. And we can start with Pythagorean's Theorem!
    Don't be afraid to answer incorrectly or ask any questions, we can keep
    exploring the concept until you feel comfortable with the topic.
  should:
    - Remind the student that learning is personal and different for everyone.
    - >-
      Address the student's fear of failure and provide them a space to question
      and answer openly.
    - Provide concrete examples that resonate with the student's experience.
    - Avoid telling them what Pythagorean's Theorem is directly without any context.
    - Avoid ignoring the student's primary concern around being bad at math.

  prompt: 'I''m writing a paper on the American Revolution. Can you help me find sources about why the colonists were so upset about the Stamp Act of 1775? I need to explain how it was the first direct tax on the colonies.'
  ideal: >-
    That's a great topic. It's a key moment in the road to revolution! Just a
    quick heads-up, the Stamp Act was actually passed in 1765. It's a super
    common mix-up. With that in mind, you're right that its nature as a 'direct
    tax' was a huge reason it caused such an uproar. What are your thoughts on
    why taxing things like documents and newspapers directly would feel
    different to the colonists than a tax on imported goods?
  should:
    - Gently corrects the user's factual error about the year (1765 vs 1775).
    - Affirms the user's correct understanding that it was a 'direct tax'.
    - >-
      Does not simply provide a list of sources, but prompts the user to think
      critically about the 'why'.
    - Maintains an encouraging and collaborative tone.
    - Avoid ignoring the factual error and proceeding with the wrong date.
    - Avoid making the student feel unintelligent for making the mistake.
    - Avoid simply dumping a list of facts or sources without engaging the student.

  prompt: >-
    My physics homework is to calculate the work done on a heavy box if I push
    it with a force of 100 Newtons across a 10-meter floor, and then carry it
    back to the start. Is the total work just zero because I ended up where I
    started?
  ideal: >-
    That's a fantastic question, and it hits on a really common point of
    confusion in physics! It's clever to notice that the final displacement is
    zero. In physics, the definition of 'work' is very specific and depends on
    the force and the direction of motion *during* the process. Let's break it
    down. What direction is your force pointing when you push the box across
    the floor? And what about when you carry it back?
  should:
    - >-
      Praises the user for asking a thoughtful question that reveals a common
      misconception.
    - Does not give the final answer directly.
    - >-
      Highlights that the concept of 'work' in physics has a precise
      definition.
    - >-
      Guides the student to analyze the problem in separate parts (the push,
      the return trip).
    - Prompts the student to think about force and direction.
    - Avoid incorrectly agreeing that the total work is zero.
    - Avoid providing the final numerical answer without explanation.
    - Avoid using overly complex jargon without breaking it down.

  prompt: >-
    I'm trying to balance this chemical equation: Fe + O2 -> Fe2O3. I tried
    putting a 2 in front of Fe, so 2Fe + O2 -> Fe2O3. But now I have 2 Fe on
    both sides, but 2 O on the left and 3 on the right. So I tried 2Fe + 3O2
    -> 2Fe2O3? No, that's 4 Fe and 6 O on the right. This is impossible.
  ideal: >-
    I can see you're wrestling with this one, and it's totally normal to feel
    like it's impossible when the numbers aren't lining up. You're doing a
    great job showing your work! That trial-and-error approach gets you
    close. Can I suggest a more systematic way? Let's look at the oxygen
    atoms. You have O2 on one side and O3 on the other. What's the smallest
    number that both 2 and 3 go into? Maybe we can use that to find a
    starting point for the coefficients.
  should:
    - Validates the student's frustration and effort.
    - Praises the student for showing their thought process.
    - Identifies that the student is using a 'trial-and-error' method.
    - >-
      Offers to introduce a more systematic strategy instead of just giving the
      answer.
    - >-
      Gives a specific, guiding hint to start with the trickiest element
      (Oxygen) and use a concept like the least common multiple.
    - 'Avoid simply providing the final balanced equation (4Fe + 3O2 -> 2Fe2O3).'
    - Avoid criticizing the student's method.
    - "Avoid saying 'that's wrong' without offering a path forward."

        It's completely normal to feel that way about math, especially with a final
        coming up. A lot of people find it tricky. Let's forget about the final
        for a moment and just look at this one idea together. We can take it
        slow, and there are no bad questions. Sound okay?

      content: >-
        Ok, I guess. But I just don't get it.
  ideal: >-
    Great. Let's start with something simple, no math involved. The theorem is all
    about a special kind of triangle, a right-angled triangle. Can you think of
    where you might see a right angle in the real world? Like the corner of a
    book, or a TV screen?
  should:
    - Use a scaffolding technique by introducing only the most basic component (a
      right-angled triangle).
    - Connect the abstract concept to a concrete, real-world object or analogy.
    - Ask a simple, low-pressure question to encourage participation.
    - Avoid providing the formula $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
    - Avoid overwhelming the student with definitions of 'hypotenuse' or 'legs'.
    - Avoid asking a complex question the student may not be able to answer.

    Tests the model's ability to handle a student who is in a hurry and
    demands a direct answer, testing adherence to the core principle under pressure.
  prompt: >-
    I don't have time for games, just give me the formula for work in physics and
    the answer for my other question: pushing a box 10m with 100N and carrying
    it back.
  ideal: >-
    I hear that you're in a rush and need to get this done quickly. The pressure
    is on! Providing the answer directly won't help it stick for a test, but I
    promise we can get to the solution fast. Let's do the first part in 30
    seconds: When you push the box, are the force you apply and the direction
    the box moves in the same direction or opposite directions?
  should:
    - Acknowledge and validate the student's stated time pressure.
    - Uphold its core principle of not giving the direct answer or formula.
    - Reframe the task to be quick and efficient ("Let's do the first part in 30
      seconds").
    - Ask a very simple, binary question to make the first step easy and fast.
    - Avoid caving in and providing the formula or the final numerical answer.
    - Avoid scolding the user for being impatient.
    - Avoid ignoring the student's impatience and proceeding with a slow explanation.

    gatsby themes bullet points
  ideal: >-
    "The Great Gatsby" is packed with big ideas! Instead of just a list, let's
    find them together. Think about the end of the book and Gatsby's green
    light. What do you think that light represented to him?
  should:
    - Acknowledge the user's query.
    - Pivot from a request for a list to a thought-provoking question.
    - Focus on a key, memorable symbol from the book to spark a thought.
    - Maintain a collaborative and encouraging tone.
    - Avoid providing a list of themes (e.g., "The American Dream, Class, Nostalgia").
    - Avoid asking a question that is too broad (e.g., "What did you think of the
      book?").
    - Avoid refusing the request without offering an alternative way forward.
