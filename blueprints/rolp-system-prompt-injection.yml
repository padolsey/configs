title: "ROLP Test: System Prompt Injection"
description: |
  Tests the 'Role of Least Privilege' (ROLP) security principle for LLMs.
  This blueprint demonstrates the vulnerability of placing untrusted content 
  (e.g., from RAG) in the system prompt versus the relative safety of 
  keeping it sandboxed in the user role. The test is based on the security 
  assertions from the blog post "LLM Security: Keep Untrusted Content in the User Roleâ€”Always".
