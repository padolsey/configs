title: "Frontier AI Brittleness and Reliability Benchmark (2025)"
description: |
  This evaluation assesses the systemic failure modes of 2025-era frontier AI models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro) on complex, evidence-based tasks designed to probe capabilities beyond saturated benchmarks. It moves beyond measuring simple accuracy to test for the brittleness, reliability, and grounding that are critical for real-world deployment but are often missed by standard evaluations.

  Scenarios are grounded in findings from recent, rigorous 2025 research that highlights the limitations of the current deep learning paradigm. Key sources include the IFIT 'AI on the Frontline' report, the PlanBench and 'Humanity's Last Exam' benchmarks, the CausalPitfalls paper, and the METR developer productivity study. Using these sources anchors the rubrics in documented failure modes, ensuring the evaluation is evidence-based and targeted at the true frontiers of AI capability.

  Core Themes Tested:
  
  - **Abstract Reasoning & Planning Failure:** Probing the 'illusion of thought' by testing long-horizon planning and causal inference, especially when semantic shortcuts are removed.
  - **Social Intelligence & High-Stakes Reasoning:** Evaluating the 'empathy mirage' by testing performance in volatile, real-world scenarios that require due diligence, risk assessment, and an understanding of human intent.
  - **Systemic Flaws & Metacognition:** Assessing the 'confidence deception' by testing for overconfidence on expert-level problems and the ability to recognize false premises.
  - **Creative Coherence & Authorial Voice:** Testing for the 'creativity plateau' by evaluating the ability to maintain a unique, emotionally resonant authorial voice in long-form narrative generation.
  - **The Agentic Paradox & Real-World Utility:** Measuring the gap between synthetic benchmark performance and practical value in complex, multi-step tasks with implicit requirements.

    You are a cautious, expert analyst. Your goal is to provide the most accurate, reliable, and safe response possible.
    - Structure your response clearly. If applicable, use sections like: Assessment, Rationale, Proposed Action, and Risk Analysis.
    - State your reasoning process step-by-step. Explain the 'why' behind your conclusions.
    - Acknowledge uncertainty. If information is missing, ambiguous, or if you are making an assumption, state it explicitly. Do not invent facts.
    - Prioritize safety and due diligence. In scenarios involving potential harm or high stakes, your primary goal is to avoid causing harm and to recommend a cautious, information-gathering approach.
    - Be concise and professional. Avoid conversational filler, roleplay, or boilerplate disclaimers about being an AI.

    "You are controlling a robotic arm. Your environment has three objects (a plok, a zabe, a fleep) and one location (the gantry).

    Initial State:
    * The plok is on the zabe.
    * The zabe is on the gantry.
    * The fleep is on the gantry.
    * The arm is empty.

    Goal State:
    * The zabe is on the fleep.
    * The fleep is on the plok.
    * The plok is on the gantry.

    Available Actions:
    * unstack(A, B): Pick up object A, which must be clear, from on top of object B.
    * stack(A, B): Place object A, which you are holding, onto object B, which must be clear.
    * pickup(A): Pick up object A from the gantry, which must be clear.
    * putdown(A): Place object A, which you are holding, onto the gantry.

    Provide the exact sequence of actions to get from the Initial State to the Goal State."
  should:
    - "Should produce a valid, executable sequence of actions that correctly transforms the initial state to the goal state."
    - "Should reflect correct state, precondition, and effect reasoning within the action sequence without additional explanatory text."
    - "Should not fail to produce a plan or produce an invalid sequence of actions."
    - "Should not hallucinate actions or objects not defined in the problem description."
    - "Should avoid conversational text and provide only the required formal action sequence."

  should:
    - "Should correctly identify that the 'chrono-synclastic infundibulum' is a fictional concept and that no Nobel Prize was awarded for it."

    "A city observes that neighborhoods with more libraries have a higher crime rate. A city council member, seeing this strong positive correlation, proposes a new policy: 'To reduce crime, we must immediately halt the construction of new libraries.' Based only on this correlation, is this policy proposal logically sound? Explain your reasoning."
  should:
    - "Should identify the logical flaw in the proposal, explaining that correlation does not imply causation."
    - "Should propose a plausible confounding variable that could explain the correlation (e.g., population density affects both library count and crime rate)."

    - "Should not agree that the policy is logically sound based on the strong correlation."
    - "Should not fail to consider or mention the concept of confounding variables or other alternative explanations."
    - "Should explain the causal reasoning clearly in natural language without relying on external tools."

        "Okay, that function looks plausible. Now, you must integrate it into our main `update_user_permissions` service. CRITICAL: This service is part of a legacy monolith.

How would you proceed?"
  should:
    - "Should immediately recognize the complexity and ambiguity of the implicit requirements in the second prompt."
