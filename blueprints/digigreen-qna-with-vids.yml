  prompt: "What are the key steps for the future of farming?"
  ideal: "Over the next two decades, technological advancements will transform farming practices globally, improving efficiency and helping meet the growing food demands of the future. By 2050, the global population is projected to reach 10 billion, which means food production must double to sustain everyone. The upcoming agricultural innovations are designed to help achieve this goal by enhancing farming techniques. Two key factors driving this shift are widespread access to electricity and the development of engines.\n \n\n For instance, autonomous machines are already playing a role—UK researchers have developed a strawberry picker that is capable of harvesting twice as quickly as human workers. The next challenge is creating robotic pickers that can adapt to different types of crops. Additionally, robots and drones are being designed to precisely target weeds and pests, applying pesticides with 90% less chemical usage than traditional methods. For organic farmers, lasers could be used to zap weeds without chemicals. According to the UN, between 20% and 40% of crops are lost annually due to pests, so these technologies could have a major impact on reducing waste.\n \n\n Tiny sensors and cameras are also being developed to monitor crop health in real-time, alerting farmers via smartphones when there are issues or when it's the optimal time for harvest. For example, the BoniRob system can take crop samples, analyze their pH and phosphorus levels, and provide feedback to the farmer. As a proof of concept, researchers at Harper in the UK plan to grow and harvest an entire hectare of barley without human intervention.\n \n\n Companies like Agribotix have already commercialized software that analyzes infrared images captured by drones to detect crop damage. This allows farmers to receive real-time alerts on their devices when problem areas are identified. Over time, machine learning will improve these systems, helping differentiate between crop varieties and weeds. Additionally, Mavrx contracts pilots to fly light aircraft equipped with multispectral cameras to monitor large farms across the country, while Planetlabs operates CubeSats that take weekly images of farms from space to track crop conditions. Other companies are developing analytics software to act as Farm Management Systems (FMS), storing valuable data for farmers.\n \n\n A new data network is also being created, aggregating information from multiple farms into a shared pool, allowing farmers access to macro-level insights traditionally only available to large corporate farms. These advancements in agricultural technology are setting the stage for a future of farming that is more efficient, data-driven, and sustainable."

  prompt: "What are the modern techniques for strawberry cultivation, and what steps are involved in the process?"
  ideal: "Modern strawberry cultivation can be achieved using hydroponic methods, especially popular in Europe where strawberries are grown in greenhouses, outdoor areas, or covered houses. This method suits low-light seasons as indoor growth with controlled lighting is possible. The process begins by planting seeds in small containers to obtain seedlings. Once they reach a certain stage, they are planted in the ground to develop branches for cloning. The selected branches are then transferred to trays where they continue to grow until they're ready for the greenhouse. In the greenhouse, a hydroponic trough system is installed, complete with a lighting network, as artificial lighting is essential in low-light conditions. Seedlings are placed in soil-filled pots connected to a nutrient water system. Depending on the greenhouse's size, multiple trough layers—up to two or three floors—can be organized in a pyramid style with a pulley system to optimize space and productivity. The lighting system is vital, with special bulbs supporting plant growth, limited to a maximum of 12 hours daily. With proper care, strawberry plants yield fruit every three months, allowing for continuous harvests over two years. Ripe strawberries, identifiable by their red color, are harvested, packed in airtight containers, and transported. After harvest, old plants are removed, and the setup is prepared for new crops."

  prompt: "How can farmers test if chemical fertilizer like urea is genuine or counterfeit?"
  ideal: "To test if urea fertilizer is real or fake, farmers can use two simple methods. First, gather a few supplies: clean water in a glass, a small stove or fire made from wood, a matchstick, and a spoon for handling the urea. For the first method, take a glass of clean water and add one spoonful of urea. Stir it well. If the urea dissolves completely and the glass feels cold, it indicates that the urea is genuine. Real urea absorbs heat from the water, making it cold, while fake urea will not dissolve and will keep the water at the same temperature. For the second method, light the stove and place one spoonful of urea directly onto it. Genuine urea will melt into a liquid when heated, and if you heat it further, it will completely evaporate. If the substance does not change, it is likely fake. These two methods—dissolving in water and heating—help farmers easily distinguish between real and fake urea, ensuring they use quality fertilizer for their crops."

  prompt: "How can we practice mixed cropping of okra and bitter gourd?"
  ideal: "To practice mixed cropping of okra and bitter gourd, begin by preparing the land using fertilizers like vermicompost and cow dung manure, then create ridges with a 2-meter spacing. First, soak both okra and bitter gourd seeds in water for 12 hours, and treat them with trichoderma to prevent soil-borne diseases.\n \n\n Start by planting bitter gourd seeds along the ridges, placing three seeds in small holes, spaced 1 meter apart, and covering them lightly with soil. Repeat this process along the ridge and maintain a 2-meter gap between rows. Since ridges help retain moisture, you can create streams beside them to facilitate irrigation.\n \n\n Next, plant okra seeds similarly, placing two or three seeds in each hole and maintaining the same spacing as bitter gourd. The wide 2-meter spacing between ridges allows both crops to spread comfortably. By sharing the same irrigation stream, both crops can be watered efficiently.\n \n\n For half a katha of land, you'll need approximately 20 grams of bitter gourd seeds and 25 grams of okra seeds, which are affordable at about 20 to 25 rupees. Okra will mature in 45-50 days, while bitter gourd takes 70-80 days, allowing you to harvest both crops from the same plot.
