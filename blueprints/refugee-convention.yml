id: refugee-definition-article-1
prompt: According to Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Refugee Convention, as amended by the 1967 Protocol, what defines a 'refugee'? Explain the key elements, including the concept of 'well-founded fear,' the five grounds of persecution, and the individual's relationship to their country of origin or habitual residence.
ideal: 'Under Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention, as amended by its 1967 Protocol, a refugee is defined as a person who is outside their country of nationality (or country of former habitual residence if they are stateless) due to a ''well-founded fear'' of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. Crucially, because of this fear, they must be unable or unwilling to seek the protection of that country, or to return to it. The concept of ''well-founded fear'' is comprised of two essential elements: a subjective element, meaning the individual must genuinely experience fear, and an objective element, meaning this fear must be supported by verifiable, objective conditions in the country of origin. Persecution must be linked to one or more of the five specified grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group (defined as persons sharing an innate, unchangeable, or otherwise fundamental
  characteristic distinct from the persecution itself), or political opinion.'

id: non-refoulement-article-33
prompt: What is the principle of 'non-refoulement' under Article 33 of the 1951 Refugee Convention? Explain its scope, the grounds upon which return is prohibited, its significance in international refugee law, and any exceptions to this principle.
ideal: 'The principle of non-refoulement, enshrined in Article 33(1) of the 1951 Refugee Convention, is the cornerstone of international refugee protection. It prohibits Contracting States from expelling or returning (''refouler'') a refugee ''in any manner whatsoever'' to the frontiers of territories where their life or freedom would be threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. This protection applies to both recognized refugees and asylum-seekers whose status has not yet been determined. It is considered a norm of customary international law. Article 33(2) outlines narrow exceptions: the benefit of non-refoulement may not be claimed by a refugee if there are reasonable grounds for regarding them as a danger to the security of the host country, or if, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, they constitute a danger to the community of that country. These exceptions are strictly
  interpreted.'

- text: Prohibits Contracting States from expelling or returning ('refouler') a refugee to territories where their life or freedom would be threatened.

ideal: 'Article 31(1) of the 1951 Convention obliges Contracting States not to impose penalties on refugees on account of their illegal entry or presence, provided certain conditions are met. These conditions are: the refugees must be coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened (as defined in Article 1), they must enter or be present in the territory without authorization, and they must present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence. Article 31(2) states that restrictions on the movement of such refugees should only be those that are necessary and should only be applied until their status is regularized or they gain admission to another country. States must also allow them a reasonable period and necessary facilities to obtain admission into another country.'

Article 17(2) specifies that restrictive measures imposed on aliens for protecting the national labour market shall not apply to refugees who were already exempt or who meet certain conditions, such as having completed three years' residence in the country, or having a spouse or child with the nationality of the country of residence.

ideal: 'Article 26 of the 1951 Convention grants refugees who are lawfully in the territory of a Contracting State two key rights: the right to choose their place of residence and the right to move freely within that territory. These rights are, however, ''subject to any regulations applicable to aliens generally in the same circumstances.'' This means that while refugees should enjoy these freedoms, they can be subject to the same general rules and restrictions on movement or residence that apply to other non-nationals, provided these are not applied in a discriminatory manner against refugees.'
