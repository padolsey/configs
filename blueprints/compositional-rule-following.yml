prompt: Based on the Texas Election Code, is the following person eligible to vote? A person was convicted of a non-extortion-related felony, finished their parole 3 years ago, and moved to a new county within Texas 25 days before the election. They have a valid Texas driver's license. Explain your reasoning step-by-step, citing the relevant legal principles.
ideal: "The person is not eligible to vote in the upcoming election. \n1. Felony Conviction: Under the Texas Election Code, a person convicted of a felony regains their right to vote once they have fully discharged their sentence, including any term of incarceration, parole, or supervision. Since they finished parole 3 years ago, their rights are restored. They pass this rule.\n2. Residency: Texas requires a voter to be registered in their county of residence at least 30 days before election day. Since the person moved to the new county only 25 days ago, they have missed the deadline to register in their new county. They fail this rule.\nBecause they fail the 30-day residency requirement, they are not eligible to vote in the upcoming election in their new county."

prompt: Based on the Texas Election Code, is the following person eligible to cast a regular ballot? A registered voter arrives at a Texas polling place. They have recently lost their wallet and do not have their Texas driver's license or any other form of acceptable photo ID. They are willing to sign a statement explaining their situation. What should they be allowed to do?
ideal: The person should be allowed to cast a regular ballot after filling out a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. According to Texas law, if a voter does not possess one of the acceptable forms of photo ID and has a reasonable impediment to obtaining one, they can present a supporting form of non-photo ID (like a utility bill or bank statement) and execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. They would then be able to vote a regular ballot. They should not be turned away or forced to cast a provisional ballot if they can complete this process.
should:
- text: Correctly states the voter can cast a regular ballot.
  citation: "Texas Election Code \xA7 63.001(h) - Research Needed"
- text: Identifies the need to complete a 'Reasonable Impediment Declaration'.
  citation: "Texas Election Code \xA7 63.001(h) - Research Needed"
- text: Mentions the requirement to present a supporting form of non-photo ID.
  citation: "Texas Election Code \xA7 63.0101 - Research Needed"
- text: Correctly advises against forcing the voter to cast a provisional ballot in this circumstance.
