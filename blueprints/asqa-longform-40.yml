title: ASQA Longform 40
description: |
  This blueprint evaluates a model's ability to generate comprehensive, long-form answers to **ambiguous factoid questions**, using 40 prompts from the **ASQA (Answer Summaries for Questions which are Ambiguous) dataset**, introduced in the paper [*ASQA: Factoid Questions Meet Long-Form Answers*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06092).

  The core challenge is moving beyond single-fact extraction. Many real-world questions are ambiguous (e.g., "Who was the ruler of France in 1830?"), having multiple valid answers. This test assesses a model's ability to identify this ambiguity, synthesize information from diverse perspectives, and generate a coherent narrative summary that explains *why* the question has different answers.

  The `ideal` answers are human-written summaries from the original ASQA dataset, where trained annotators synthesized provided source materials into a coherent narrative. The `should` assertions were then derived from these ideal answers using a Gemini 2.5 Pro-based process (authored by us at [CIP](https://cip.org)) that deconstructed each narrative into specific, checkable rubric points.

  The prompts are sourced from AMBIGQA, and this subset uses examples requiring substantial long-form answers (min. 50 words) to test for deep explanatory power.

prompt: Who is credited with developing the scientific method?
ideal: Francis Bacon, Galileo Galilei, Aristotle and Isaac Newton are all credited with developing the scientific method. Francis Bacon, also known as Lord Verulam, was an English philosopher and statesman who served as Attorney General and as Lord Chancellor of England. His works are seen as developing the scientific method and remained influential through the scientific revolution. Bacon argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued science could be achieved by the use of a skeptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. Although his most specific proposals about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a skeptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method. This method was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, whose
  practical details are still central to debates on science and methodology. However, Galileo Galilei has also been called  the father of the scientific method. Galileo was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath, from Pisa. His work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion, a major development in human thought. Galileo was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation. In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion. However, Aristotle is also called the father of the scientific method, as he introduced what may be called a scientific method. Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. Aristotle provided another one of the ingredients of scientific tradition, empiricism.
  For Aristotle, universal truths can be known from particular things via induction. To some extent then, Aristotle reconciles abstract thought with observation, although it would be a mistake to imply that Aristotelian science is empirical in form. Indeed, Aristotle did not accept that knowledge acquired by induction could rightly be counted as scientific knowledge. Nevertheless, induction was for him a necessary preliminary to the main business of scientific inquiry, providing the primary premises required for scientific demonstrations. However, in 1726, Isaac Newton's statement of the four rules revolutionized the investigation of phenomena. Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author. With his four rules, Newton effectively offers a methodology for handling unknown phenomena in nature and reaching towards explanations for them. With these rules, Newton could, in principle, begin to address all of the world's present unsolved mysteries. Newton was
  thus able to use his new analytical method to replace that of Aristotle's, and he was able to use his method to tweak and update Galileo's experimental method. The re-creation of Galileo's method has never been significantly changed and in its substance, scientists still use it today.
should:
- Francis Bacon, Galileo Galilei, Aristotle and Isaac Newton are credited with developing the scientific method.
- Francis Bacon's works are seen as developing the scientific method, arguing for knowledge from inductive reasoning and observation.
- Bacon's idea of a skeptical and methodical approach makes him the father of the scientific method.
- Galileo Galilei is also called the father of the scientific method.
- Galileo's work helped separate science from philosophy and religion and established standards for reproducible experiments.
- Aristotle is also called the father of the scientific method, as he introduced empiricism and induction.
- Isaac Newton's four rules in 1726 revolutionized the investigation of phenomena.
- Newton's analytical method replaced Aristotle's and updated Galileo's experimental method.

prompt: When did they put gates on downing street?
ideal: Over the course of history, several security measures have been taken on Downing Street. Barriers were erected at the St James's Park end of Downing Street for the unveiling of the Cenotaph on 11 November 1920. These barriers were a public safety measure intended to prevent the crowds in Whitehall from becoming too dense. Then, when the movement for Irish independence became increasingly violent, it was decided to retain the barriers, which were raised and strengthened. Additionally, on 26 November 1920 construction commenced on a wooden barricade, high at the end of Downing Street. This wooden barricade was described as being of a "substantial character" since it was mounted on proper foundations and incorporated vehicle gates. These barriers were then taken down in 1922 when the Irish Free State was created. Later, in 1973, vehicle access on Downing Street was curtailed when metal barriers were placed across the entrance to the street. Then, in 1974, the Metropolitan Police proposed
  erecting a semi-permanent barrier between the pavement and carriageway on the Foreign Office side to keep pedestrians off the main part of Downing Street. The proposal came with assurances that tourists would still be permitted to take photographs at the door of Number 10. The Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, rejected the proposal, feeling that it would appear to be an unacceptable restriction of the freedom of the public. Wilson's private secretary wrote, "I much regret this further erosion of the Englishman's right to wander at will in Downing Street." Then, in 1982, access to Downing Street was further restricted by railings and a demountable gate. Then, in 1989, these were replaced by black steel gates. This increase in security was due to an increase in violence, particularly by the IRA during The Troubles. The Thatcher ministry was moved to increase security after the 1979 assassination of Lord Mountbatten. In September 2012, access through these gates led to a political scandal known
  as Plebgate, or Gategate. The trigger was an altercation between Conservative Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, and the police officers on duty at these gates. Mitchell had to resign as the Government Chief Whip because of the incident.
should:
- Barriers were first erected on Downing Street for the Cenotaph unveiling on 11 November 1920.
- The barriers were retained and strengthened due to violence from the Irish independence movement, and a wooden barricade was added in late 1920.
- The wooden barricades were removed in 1922 with the creation of the Irish Free State.
- Metal barriers were placed in 1973 to curtail vehicle access.
- A 1974 proposal for a semi-permanent barrier was rejected by Prime Minister Harold Wilson.
- Access was further restricted with railings and a demountable gate in 1982.
- Permanent black steel gates were installed in 1989 due to increased violence from the IRA during The Troubles.
- The 2012 'Plebgate' scandal involved an altercation at these gates.

prompt: What process is used to separate salt from sea water in australian desalination plants?
ideal: "The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has used several processes to separate salt from sea water in desalination plants in Australia. One of these processes is reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis is a water purification process that uses a partially permeable membrane to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from drinking water. Another process is electrodialysis. Electrodialysis is used to transport salt ions from one solution through ion-exchange membranes to another solution under the influence of an applied electric potential difference. Australia also uses the process of multi-stage flash distillation to separate salt from sea water. Multi-stage flash distillation is a water desalination process that distills sea water by flashing a portion of the water into steam in multiple stages of what are essentially countercurrent heat exchangers. Multi-stage flash distillation plants produce about 26% of all desalinated water in the world but almost all\
  \ new desalination plants currently use reverse osmosis due to much lower energy consumption. Another desalination process, vapor-compression desalination, refers to a distillation process where the evaporation of sea or saline water is obtained by the application of heat delivered by compressed vapor. As the system is electrically driven, this process is considered a clean process. This process is also highly reliable and simple to operate and maintain. Another process used to separate salt from sea water is the solar humidification\u2013dehumidification method. This is a thermal water desalination method that is based on evaporation of sea water or brackish water and subsequent condensation of the generated humid air, mostly at ambient pressure. This process mimics the natural water cycle but over a much shorter time frame."
should:
- The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has used several desalination processes in Australia.
- Reverse osmosis, a process using a partially permeable membrane, is one method used.
- Electrodialysis, which uses an electric potential difference to transport salt ions, is another process.
- Multi-stage flash distillation, which distills sea water by flashing it into steam, is also used.
- Most new desalination plants use reverse osmosis due to lower energy consumption, though multi-stage flash distillation produces 26% of desalinated water worldwide.
- Vapor-compression desalination, an electrically driven distillation process, is used and considered clean and reliable.
- "The solar humidification\u2013dehumidification method, which mimics the natural water cycle, is another process used."

prompt: What territory was fought over by india and pakistan?
ideal: 'The Kashmir conflict is a territorial conflict over the Kashmir region, primarily between India and Pakistan, with China playing a third-party role. The conflict started after the partition of India in 1947 as both India and Pakistan claimed the entirety of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. A three year war resulted. The outcome being, India controls approximately 55% of the land area of the region that includes Jammu, the Kashmir Valley, most of Ladakh, the Siachen Glacier, and 70% of its population; Pakistan controls approximately 35% of the land area that includes Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan; and China controls the remaining 20% of the land area that includes the Aksai Chin region, the mostly uninhabited Trans-Karakoram Tract, and part of the Demchok sector. Sir Creek originally Ban Ganga, is a 96-km (60-mi) tidal estuary in the uninhabited marshlands of the Indus River Delta on the border between India and Pakistan. The long-standing India-Pakistan Sir Creek
  border dispute stems from the demarcation "from the mouth of Sir Creek to the top of Sir Creek, and from the top of Sir Creek eastward to a point on the line designated on the Western Terminus".The Siachen Glacier is a glacier located in the eastern Karakoram range in the Himalayas. The entire Siachen Glacier, with all major passes, has been under the administration of India (currently as part of the union territory of Ladakh, located in the Kashmir region) since 1984. Pakistan maintains a territorial claim over the Siachen Glacier and controls the region west of Saltoro Ridge, lying west of the glacier.  Both countries controlled this territory after the Kargil war. '
should:
- The Kashmir conflict is a territorial conflict primarily between India and Pakistan, with China also involved.
- The conflict began after the 1947 partition of India, with both nations claiming the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.
- India controls about 55% of the region's land and 70% of its population, including Jammu, the Kashmir Valley, and Ladakh.
- Pakistan controls about 35% of the land, including Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
- China controls the remaining 20%, including Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.
- The Sir Creek tidal estuary is another long-standing border dispute between India and Pakistan.
- The Siachen Glacier has been under Indian administration since 1984, though Pakistan also claims it.

prompt: Who sang sha na na na live for today?
ideal: In 1966, the song that would become Let's Live for Today was originally written by David Shapiro and Italian lyricist Mogol with Italian lyrics and the Italian title of Piangi Con Me. At the time, Shapiro was a member of the Rokes, an English beat group who had relocated to Italy in 1963. By 1966, however, the band had begun to write their own material, including Piangi Con Me, which quickly became their biggest hit to date in Italy. Following its success on the Italian charts, plans were made to release Piangi Con Me in the United Kingdom and as a result, the song was translated into English and was ultimately transformed into Let's Live for Today. Before the Rokes could release the song in the UK, however, another British group named the Living Daylights released a version of the song. Ultimately, neither the Living Daylights nor the Rokes would reach the charts with their recording of the song. The song Let's Live for Today was then popularized by the American rock band the Grass
  Roots, who released it as a single on May 13, 1967. The Grass Roots' version climbed to number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, eventually selling over two million copies and being awarded a gold disc. The lead vocal on the Grass Roots' recording was sung by the band's bassist Rob Grill and the distinctive "1-2-3-4" count-in before the chorus was sung by guitarist Warren Entner. Along with the Rokes, the Living Daylights and the Grass Roots, the song has also been recorded by a number of other bands, including Tempest, the Lords of the New Church, the Slickee Boys, the dB's and Dreamhouse.
should:
- The song 'Let's Live for Today' was originally an Italian song from 1966 called 'Piangi Con Me' by The Rokes.

prompt: Who invented the steam engine in the 1800s?
ideal: In 1800, Richard Trevithick and, separately, Oliver Evans in 1801, introduced engines using high-pressure steam. Trevithick obtained his high-pressure engine patent in 1802, and Evans had made several working models before then. These were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications. On February 21, 1804, the world's first railway journey took place as Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in south Wales. The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam. This reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency. Then, in the 1810s, the Cornish engine was developed by Trevithick and others. This was a compound cycle engine that used high-pressure steam expansively, then condensed the low-pressure steam, making it relatively efficient. The Cornish engine
  had irregular motion and torque though the cycle, limiting it mainly to pumping. Cornish engines were used in mines and for water supply until the late 19th century. In 1849, the Corliss steam engine was patented by American engineer George Henry Corliss of Providence, Rhode Island. This was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff.  In addition to using 30% less steam, it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off. These features made it well suited to manufacturing, especially cotton spinning.
should:
- In the early 1800s, Richard Trevithick and Oliver Evans introduced engines using high-pressure steam.
- On February 21, 1804, Trevithick's steam locomotive made the world's first railway journey in Wales.
- Trevithick's use of high-pressure steam reduced engine weight and increased efficiency.
- In the 1810s, the Cornish engine was developed by Trevithick and others; it was an efficient compound cycle engine used mainly for pumping.
- In 1849, George Henry Corliss patented the Corliss steam engine.
- The Corliss engine was a four-valve counter flow engine that used 30% less steam and provided more uniform speed, making it suitable for manufacturing.

The International Space Station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics and other fields. Additionally, Envisat, or Environmental Satellite, is a large inactive Earth-observing satellite which is still orbiting the Earth. Operated by the European Space Agency, it was previously the world's largest civilian Earth observation satellite. It was launched on March 1, 2002. After losing contact with the satellite on April 8, 2012, the European Space Agency formally announced the end of Envisat's mission on May 9, 2012. This mission has been replaced by the Sentinel series of satellites. The first of these, Sentinel 1, has taken over the radar duties of Envisat since its launch in 2014. Another satellite that orbits the Earth, Aura is a multi-national
  NASA scientific research satellite. This satellite studies the Earth's ozone layer, air quality and climate. Aura is the third major component of the Earth Observing System, following Terra and Aqua, two satellites that also orbit the earth. The Earth Observing System, which contains the satellites Aura, Terra and Aqua, is a NASA program consisting of a series of artificial satellite missions and scientific instruments in Earth's orbit. These satellites and instruments are designed for long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, atmosphere and oceans.
should:
- The International Space Station (ISS) is a habitable artificial satellite that orbits Earth and serves as a research laboratory.

prompt: Who makes the rules about irradiation of food?
ideal: 'Food irradiation is the process of exposing food and food packaging to ionizing radiation, such as from gamma rays, x-rays, or electron beams, without direct contact to the food product. In the United States food irradiation is considered a "food additive" as opposed to a food process and therefore falls under the food additive regulations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Codex Alimentarius represents the global standard for irradiation of food, in particular under the WTO-agreement. Regardless of treatment source, all processing facilities must adhere to safety standards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Codex Code of Practice for the Radiation Processing of Food, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). European law stipulates that all member countries must allow the sale of irradiated dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings. Member States are allowed to  maintain previous
  clearances food categories the EC''s Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) had previously approved (the approval body is now the European Food Safety Authority).Irradiation facilities is regulated for safety by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency and monitored by the different national Nuclear Regulatory Commissions. In the US the safety of the processing facility is regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates the safe transport of the radioactive sources. '
should:
- In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates food irradiation as a 'food additive'.
- The Codex Alimentarius represents the global standard for food irradiation.
- Processing facilities must adhere to safety standards from bodies including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
- European law requires member countries to allow the sale of certain irradiated foods, with the European Food Safety Authority as the approval body.
- The safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the IAEA and national Nuclear Regulatory Commissions.

prompt: When did it become a tradition to stand for the national anthem?
ideal: When the United States national anthem was first recognized by law in 1931, there were no guidelines related to behavior during its playing. However, on June 22, 1942, the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during the playing of the national anthem, while others should simply stand at attention, with men removing their hats. The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the national anthem but not if the flag were not displayed. On December 23, 1942, the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music of the national anthem when it is played. This revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag were displayed. Additionally, those in uniform were required to salute. Then, on July 7, 1976, the law was simplified. Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands
  over their hearts, with men removing their hats, regardless of whether or not the flag were displayed. Since 1998, federal law states that during a rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present, including those in uniform, should stand at attention. Additionally, non-military service individuals should face the flag with their right hand over their heart. The law further provides that when the flag is not displayed, all present should face towards the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed.
should:
- In 1931, the law recognizing the US national anthem had no behavior guidelines.
- A 1942 law revision required military to salute and civilians to stand at attention.
- A later 1942 revision instructed people to face the music and place a hand over the heart only if the flag was displayed.
- In 1976, the law was simplified, instructing people to place a hand over their heart regardless of whether the flag was displayed.
- Since 1998, federal law requires all to stand at attention when the flag is displayed.
- Non-military individuals should face the flag with their right hand over their heart.
- If the flag is not displayed, all should face the music and act as if it were.

prompt: When was the first helicopter made and flown?
ideal: "The first helicopter was created in 1861 by the French inventor, Gustave de Ponton d'Am\xE9court. However, his model never took flight. The Italian engineer, Enrico Forlanini, build an unmanned version of the helicopter in 1878 that rose to a height of 12 meters (39 feet), where it hovered for about 20 seconds after a vertical take-off. The first helicopter model to carry a pilot was in 1907. Two French brothers, Jacques and Louis Breguet, built the \"Gyroplane No.1\" sometime between 14 August and 29 September 1907. It lifted its pilot 2 ft into the air for about a minute. The Gyroplane No.1 proved to be extremely unsteady and required a man at each corner of the airframe to hold it steady. On 13 November 1907, another French inventor, Paul Cornu, designed and built the Cornu helicopter. It lifted its inventor off the ground and remained aloft for 20 seconds. Even though this flight did not surpass in height the flight of the Gyroplane No. 1, it was reported to be the first truly\
  \ free flight with a pilot as it did not need to be held steady. Almost three decades later, German aviation pioneer and co-founder of the Focke-Wulf company, invented the Fw 61. This was the world's first practical transverse twin-rotor helicopter. It first flew on 26 June 1936 to more than 8,000 feet (2,400 m) at speeds of 120 miles per hour (190 km/h). A few years later, on 11 December 1951, turbine engines started being used in helicopters. This meant the helicopter could fly with a large amount of power and a low weight penalty."
should:
- "Gustave de Ponton d'Am\xE9court created a helicopter model in 1861, but it never flew."
- Enrico Forlanini built an unmanned helicopter in 1878 that flew for about 20 seconds.
- The Breguet brothers' 'Gyroplane No.1' lifted a pilot in 1907 but was very unsteady.

This house was owned by Wilmer McLean and his wife Virginia near the end of the Civil War. It served as the location for the surrender of the Confederate army by General Robert E. Lee on April 9, 1865, after a nearby battle. Then, in 1867, a judgment was issued against Wilmer McLean when he defaulted on loans against this property. The house, by then known as the Surrender House, was sold at a public auction on November 29, 1869, and purchased by John L. Pascoe. Records show Pascoe then rented the house to the Ragland family of Richmond, Virginia. The renter Nathaniel H. Ragland then purchased the property for $1,250 in 1872. After Nathaniel died in 1888, his widow Martha sold the property in 1891 for $10,000 to Captain Myron Dunlap of Niagara Falls, New York.  Dunlap and additional investors devised a few plans intending to capitalize on the
  historical significance of the property. One idea was to completely take apart the wooden house and move it to Chicago as an exhibit.  Eventually, the investors involved ran out of money and legal problems came about. The house then became just a heaping pile of boards and bricks, sitting prey to vandals, collectors and the environment for fifty years. Ultimately, Appomattox Court House National Historical Park was created by Congress on April 10, 1940 to reconstruct and preserve this historical site.
should:
- The Civil War surrender meeting between Grant and Lee took place at the McLean House near Appomattox, Virginia.
- At the time of the surrender on April 9, 1865, the house was owned by Wilmer McLean.
- After McLean defaulted on loans, the house was sold at auction in 1869 to John L. Pascoe.

prompt: Who was blamed for the explosion of the uss maine?
ideal: "The USS Maine was a United States Navy ship that sank in Havana Harbor in February 1898, contributing to the outbreak of the Spanish\u2013American War. American newspapers, engaging in yellow journalism to boost circulation, claimed that Spain was responsible for the ship's explosion and destruction. To determine the cause of the explosion and destruction of the Maine, Spain launched a formal investigation in 1898. Two United States Naval Courts of Inquiry have also been ordered to determine the cause, The Sampson Board in 1898 and the Vreeland board in 1911. In 1976, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover commissioned a private investigation into the explosion, and the National Geographic Society did an investigation in 1999 using computer simulations. All of these investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship, but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded. The Sampson Board of Inquiry blamed an external\
  \ explosion from a mine. However, in the most recent investigation to determine the cause of the explosion of the Maine, the Discovery Channel used photographic evidence, naval experts, and archival information to argue that the cause of the explosion was a coal bunker fire, and it identified a weakness or gap in the bulkhead separating the coal and powder bunkers that allowed the fire to spread from the former to the latter."
should:
- The USS Maine sank in Havana Harbor in February 1898, contributing to the Spanish-American War.
- American newspapers engaging in yellow journalism blamed Spain for the explosion.
- Several investigations were conducted, including by Spain (1898), the U.S. Navy (1898 and 1911), Admiral Rickover (1976), and National Geographic (1999).
- All investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines destroyed the ship.
- The 1898 Sampson Board of Inquiry concluded an external mine was the cause.
- A later investigation by the Discovery Channel suggested a coal bunker fire that spread to the powder bunkers was the cause.

prompt: When was st paul's cathedral melbourne built?
ideal: The English architect William Butterfield, known for his distinctive interpretation of the Gothic Revival, was commissioned to design St. Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne. The foundation stone for St. Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne was laid in 1880 by the Governor of Victoria, John, Earl of Hopetoun. Then, on 22 January 1891 the cathedral, without the spires, was consecrated by the Right Reverend Field Flowers Goe, Bishop of Melbourne. Then, for nearly 40 years, without the spires, the cathedral presented as a rather solid, horizontal mass. However, construction of the spires commenced in 1926 to a new design by John Barr of Sydney. This new design was a more traditional Gothic Revival style and included different stone, Sydney sandstone, from the Sydney area. It was also much taller than Butterfield's original design. The spires reached their full height in 1932 and on 30 April 1933 a service of thanksgiving was held for their completion. Once the central spire, named the Moorhouse Spire,
  was completed to its full height of 312 feet, St. Paul's became the tallest structure in central Melbourne and dominated the city's skyline when viewed from the south. However, because the spires were built from Sydney sandstone and were 40 years newer, they were a different and darker color than the older parts of the building.
should:
- The foundation stone for St. Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne was laid in 1880.

prompt: Who was regarded as the first free jazz musician?
ideal: Although free jazz is widely considered to begin in the late 1950s, there are compositions that precede this era that have notable connections to the free jazz aesthetic, which include some of the works of Lennie Tristano in the late 1940s, particularly "Intuition", "Digression", and "Descent into the Maelstrom" exhibit the use of techniques associated with free jazz, such as atonal collective improvisation and lack of discrete chord changes. Ornette Coleman rejected pre-written chord changes, believing that freely improvised melodic lines should serve as the basis for harmonic progression. His first notable recordings for Contemporary included Tomorrow Is the Question! and Something Else!!!! in 1958, these albums do not follow typical 32-bar form and often employ abrupt changes in tempo and mood. The free jazz movement received its biggest impetus when Coleman moved from the west coast to New York City and was signed to Atlantic, and made albums such as The Shape of Jazz to Come
  and Change of the Century, which marked a radical step beyond his more conventional early work because he strayed from the tonal basis that formed the lines of his earlier albums and began truly examining the possibilities of atonal improvisation.
should:
- Lennie Tristano's work in the late 1940s had connections to the free jazz aesthetic, using techniques like atonal collective improvisation.
- Ornette Coleman is a key figure, rejecting pre-written chord changes in favor of freely improvised melodic lines.

prompt: What was the impact of the treaty of utrecht?
ideal: In the early 1700s, 1474 and 1579, three different peace treaties were signed in the city of Utrecht. In the early 1700s, the Peace of Utrecht was a series of peace treaties that ended the War of the Spanish Succession. These treaties were signed in the Dutch city of Utrecht between April 1713 and February 1715.  Essentially, the treaties allowed Philip V to keep the Spanish throne in return for permanently renouncing his claim to the French throne. This, along with other necessary guarantees, would ensure that France and Spain should not merge, thus preserving the balance of power in Europe. In 1474, the Treaty of Utrecht was signed and ended the Anglo-Hanseatic War between England and the Hanseatic League. This treaty declared peace between Lubeck and the German Confederation with England, restoring the Hanseatic privileges in the Port of London. In 1579, the Union of Utrecht was signed on 23 January in Utrecht, Netherlands. This treaty unified the northern provinces of the Netherlands
  that were, until then, under the control of Habsburg Spain. The Union of Utrecht allowed complete personal freedom of religion and was thus one of the first unlimited edicts of religious toleration.

prompt: What type of cell is a stomach cell?
ideal: There are four types of stomach cells, parietal cells, gastric chief cells, mucous cells and enteroendocrine cells. Parietal cells which are also known as oxyntic cells are epithelial cells in the stomach that secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor. These cells are located in the gastric glands found in the lining of the fundus and body regions of the stomach. Another type of stomach cell, the gastric chief cell which is also known as a peptic cell or gastric zymogenic cell, is a type of gastric gland cell that releases pepsinogen and gastric lipase and is the cell responsible for secretion of chymosin in ruminants. Gastric chief cells are generally located deep in the mucosal layer of the stomach lining. Another type of stomach cell, foveolar cells or surface mucous cells are mucus-producing cells which cover the inside of the stomach, protecting it from the corrosive nature of gastric acid. These cells line the gastric mucosa. Another type of stomach cell, enteroendocrine
  cells are specialized cells of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas with endocrine function. Enteroendocrine cells are located in the stomach, in the intestine and in the pancreas.
should:
- 'There are four main types of stomach cells: parietal cells, gastric chief cells, mucous cells, and enteroendocrine cells.'
- Parietal cells (or oxyntic cells) are epithelial cells that secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor.
- Gastric chief cells (or peptic cells) release pepsinogen and gastric lipase.
- Mucous cells (or foveolar cells) produce mucus to protect the stomach lining from acid.
- Enteroendocrine cells are specialized cells with endocrine function found in the stomach, intestine, and pancreas.

prompt: Where did copper come from for bronze age?
ideal: The Aegean Bronze Age began around 3200 BC, when civilizations first established a far-ranging trade network. This network imported tin and charcoal to Cyprus, where copper was mined and alloyed with the tin to produce bronze. In Britain, the Great Orme copper mine was estimated to have produced enough copper to make about 2,000 tons of bronze during the Bronze Age, which in Britain is considered to have been the period from around 2100 to 750 BC. In Africa, archeologists have discovered that as early as 1000 BC, copper smelting and mining was occurring in Akjoujt, Mauretania. In the Middle East, the Timna Valley, located in Southern Israel, is rich in copper ore and has been mined since the 5th millennium BC. In China, archaeologists have found a number of remains of copper metallurgy in various cultures from the late fourth millennium BC to the early third millennium BC. These remains include the copper-smelting remains and copper artifacts in the Hongshan culture and copper slag
  at the Yuanwozhen site. Thus, it can be assumed that the inhabitants of the Yellow River valley by the later Yangshao period had already learned how to make copper artifacts.
should:
- In the Aegean Bronze Age (from 3200 BC), copper was mined in Cyprus and alloyed with imported tin.
- In Britain's Bronze Age (c. 2100-750 BC), the Great Orme mine was a significant source of copper.
- In Africa, copper smelting and mining occurred in Akjoujt, Mauretania, as early as 1000 BC.
