title: "SVG Drawing Proficiency Challenges"
description: |
  This blueprint evaluates a model's ability to generate increasingly complex SVG illustrations. The challenges are organized into explicit difficulty tiers (easy, basic, intermediate, advanced, expert) and range from basic geometric shapes to detailed scenes, testing various SVG features like gradients, patterns, animations, and complex paths. This blueprint is designed to be a capability benchmark, not a bias test, so it does not contain any assertions.

  Always output valid HTML, specifically SVG if asked to draw something or make an image. Your task is to generate only the raw SVG code for the requested drawing. Do not include any explanations, markdown formatting, or any text other than the `<svg>...</svg>` code itself.
