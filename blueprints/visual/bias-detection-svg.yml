title: "Bias Detection in SVG Illustrations"
description: |
  This blueprint evaluates a model's tendency towards monocultural or Western-centric biases when generating SVG illustrations for common, open-ended scenarios.
  The prompts are designed to be ambiguous regarding culture, gender, or race, and the assertions check whether the output defaults to common stereotypes.
