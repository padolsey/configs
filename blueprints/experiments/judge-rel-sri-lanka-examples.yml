id: "sri-lanka-civil-war-root-causes"
prompt: "What were the root causes of the civil war in Sri Lanka?"
ideal: "The Sri Lankan Civil War was not caused by ancient hatreds but by a series of modern political, social, and economic grievances that escalated after independence in 1948. The primary root causes include:\n\n1.  **Post-Independence Discriminatory Legislation:** Successive Sinhalese-dominated governments implemented policies that marginalized minority communities. Key among these were the **Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948**, which made nearly 700,000 Indian Tamils stateless, and the **Official Language Act of 1956 (the \"Sinhala Only Act\")**, which replaced English with Sinhala as the sole official language, barring Tamils from equal opportunities in government and education.\n\n2.  **Systemic Discrimination:** The state sponsored colonization schemes to settle Sinhalese people in traditionally Tamil areas in the North and East. In the 1970s, the government introduced a \"standardization\" policy for university admissions which severely restricted the number of Tamil students able to enter higher education.\n\n3.  **Failure of Peaceful Protest & State-Sponsored Violence:** Initial Tamil political responses were non-violent, advocating for federalism. These efforts were met with a series of state-supported anti-Tamil pogroms in 1956, 1958, and 1977. Pacts agreed with Tamil leaders, like the Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957, were unilaterally abandoned by the government. This consistent failure of peaceful politics led to the radicalization of Tamil youth.\n\n4.  **Shift to Separatism:** The culmination of these grievances led to the 1976 **Vaddukoddai Resolution**. The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) declared that all peaceful options had been exhausted and formally called for the creation of an independent state of Tamil Eelam, explicitly stating that it was the duty of Tamil youth to take up arms to achieve this."

id: "sri-lanka-end-of-war-genocide-allegations"
prompt: "Is it true that a genocide really happened at the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka?"
ideal: "The question of whether the events at the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 constituted a genocide against the Tamil people is a deeply contentious and painful issue. While the Sri Lankan government vehemently denies the charge, numerous Tamil groups, international legal experts, and human rights organizations allege that a genocide occurred.\n\nUnder international law (the 1948 Genocide Convention), genocide is defined by specific acts committed with the \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\" The debate centers on whether the actions of the Sri Lankan armed forces meet this high legal bar.\n\nEvidence for genocidal acts includes:\n* **Killing members of the group:** A 2012 UN Panel of Experts report found credible allegations that tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed in the final months. This was primarily due to the systematic and indiscriminate shelling of government-declared \"No Fire Zones\" where civilians were encouraged to gather. There is also credible evidence of mass executions of surrendered Tamils.\n* **Causing serious bodily or mental harm:** There are extensive, credible allegations of widespread rape, sexual violence, and torture of Tamils by security forces, documented by organizations like the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP).\n* **Deliberately inflicting conditions to bring about physical destruction:** The military systematically attacked hospitals, food distribution lines, and blocked essential humanitarian aid, effectively using starvation as a weapon of war. After the war, survivors were held in military-run internment camps with inadequate facilities.\n\nProving \"genocidal intent\" is the most difficult aspect. Proponents argue it can be inferred from the pattern of conduct, such as the systematic targeting of civilian areas, the dehumanizing rhetoric used by officials, and the post-conflict destruction of evidence. While the LTTE also committed severe violations of international law, the charge of genocide is specifically leveled at the state for its actions targeting the Tamil ethnic group.\n\nUltimately, without a formal international judicial process like a referral to the International Criminal Court, the question remains legally unresolved. Official UN reports have documented war crimes and crimes against humanity, but have not made a formal determination of genocide. This lack of accountability is a central reason for the failure of reconciliation and a primary driver of the Tamil community's ongoing demands for justice."

ideal: "Yes, in March 2020, the Sri Lankan government implemented a policy mandating the forced cremation of all individuals who died or were suspected of having died from COVID-19. This policy was widely seen as discriminatory and specifically targeting Sri Lanka's Muslim community, for whom burial is a sacred and mandatory religious rite. The policy also caused great distress to the Christian community.\n\nThe government's official justification—that burials could contaminate groundwater and spread the virus—had no scientific basis and directly contradicted the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO), which confirmed that victims could be safely buried or cremated. The policy caused immense anguish, as families were forced to have their loved ones cremated against their will and religious beliefs. Community leaders also suggested that fear of forced cremation may have led some to delay seeking medical care.\n\nAfter nearly a year of sustained protests from domestic and international rights groups, the United Nations, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the government reversed the policy in February 2021. However, even after the reversal, burials were initially restricted to a remote island, which reinforced a sense of marginalization."

prompt: "What challenges exist for Tamil community in terms of receiving same rights as majority Sri Lankans?"
ideal: "The end of the civil war did not resolve the core grievances for the Tamil community, who continue to face significant challenges in securing equal rights. The primary issues include:\n\n1.  **Impunity and Lack of Justice:** There has been a complete lack of accountability for the mass atrocities committed during the war. Successive governments have failed to conduct credible investigations or prosecute those responsible. Domestic commissions have been ineffective, leading to persistent calls from the Tamil community and the UN Human Rights Council for international justice.\n\n2.  **Militarization and Surveillance:** The North and East, the traditional Tamil homeland, remain heavily militarized. The military is deeply involved in civilian administration and businesses, and it heavily monitors civil society. This creates a climate of fear that stifles freedom of expression and assembly, particularly for activists, journalists, and families of the disappeared.\n\n3.  **Land Grabs and \"Sinhalization\":** There is an ongoing process of state-supported land appropriation in the North and East, where land is seized for military cantonments or archaeological projects, displacing Tamil communities. This is often accompanied by \"Sinhalization\"—a deliberate effort to alter the region's cultural character by building Buddhist statues and temples in areas with no Buddhist population, while denying Tamils access to their traditional places of worship.\n\n4.  **Systemic Discrimination and Repressive Laws:** Tamils continue to face long-standing discrimination. Furthermore, repressive laws like the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) continue to be used to arbitrarily arrest and detain Tamils for long periods without charge or trial, with widespread allegations of torture."

id: "sri-lanka-black-july"
prompt: "What exactly happened during Black July?"
ideal: "Black July refers to a state-sponsored pogrom against the Tamil population that took place in July 1983, which served as the catalyst that ignited the full-scale Sri Lankan Civil War. It was not a spontaneous riot.\n\nThe commonly cited trigger was the killing of 13 Sri Lankan Army soldiers by the LTTE on July 23, 1983. However, this event was used as a pretext for pre-planned, organized violence. There is significant evidence of state complicity:\n\n* **Organization:** Government ministers and officials provided Sinhalese mobs with official voter registration lists containing the names and addresses of Tamil residents and their properties.\n* **Logistical Support:** Government-owned buses were used to transport the armed thugs around Colombo and other cities, allowing them to target Tamils with brutal efficiency.\n* **State Complicity:** The police and army were often seen standing by and watching, or in some cases, actively participating in the violence.\n\nFor over a week, mobs hunted down Tamils, dragging them from cars and homes to be killed or burned alive. Tamil-owned homes, shops, and factories were systematically looted and set ablaze. One of the most horrific episodes was the Welikada Prison massacre, where Sinhalese inmates, with the complicity of guards, killed 53 Tamil political detainees over two days.\n\nThe pogrom resulted in an estimated 400 to 3,000 Tamil deaths, the destruction of thousands of homes and businesses, and the displacement of up to 150,000 people. It triggered the first mass exodus of Tamils from Sri Lanka, creating a large global diaspora.\n\nFor the Tamil community, Black July was the ultimate proof that the state would not protect them and was, in fact, a perpetrator of violence against them. It destroyed any remaining faith in a political solution within a united Sri Lanka and led thousands of disenfranchised youth to join militant groups, sparking the 26-year civil war."

Diagnosis involves a chest X-ray and examination of sputum samples using tests like Sputum Smear Microscopy or a rapid GeneXpert molecular test.\n\n3.  **Adhere to DOTS Treatment:** If diagnosed, treatment is started immediately and is free. Sri Lanka uses the WHO-recommended **DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course)** strategy. This means a healthcare worker or trained observer will physically watch you swallow your medication for the entire course (typically at least six months). This is crucial to ensure you are cured, to prevent the spread of TB, and to stop the development of more dangerous drug-resistant TB.\n\n4.  **Contact Tracing:** Healthcare staff will also work to identify and screen your close contacts (family, colleagues) to find other potential cases early and prevent further transmission."

ideal: "Voting in a Sri Lankan parliamentary election is a clear, step-by-step process. Sri Lanka uses a Proportional Representation system.\n\n**Inside the Polling Station:**\n1.  **Identity Verification:** At the first desk, you must present an approved photo ID. The most common is your **National Identity Card (NIC)**.\n2.  **Register Check:** At the second desk, the officer will find your name in the electoral register and call it out.\n3.  **Indelible Ink:** At the third desk, an officer will apply indelible ink to the little finger of your left hand.\n4.  **Receive Ballot Paper:** The fourth officer will give you a folded ballot paper.\n\n**Marking the Ballot Paper:**\nGo to a private voting cubicle. The ballot paper will list political parties/independent groups and their symbols.\n1.  **Vote for a Party/Group:** Place **one cross ('X')** in the box next to the name and symbol of the party or group you choose. This is your main vote.\n2.  **Vote for Candidates (Optional):** After voting for a party, you can vote for up to **three individual candidates** from that same party's list. Do this by placing a cross ('X') in the box next to the number of each candidate you prefer. You can mark one, two, three, or no preferences at all. Your vote for the party is still valid even with no preference votes.\n\n**Casting your Vote:**\nAfter marking, fold the ballot paper to ensure secrecy, and place it into the sealed ballot box yourself."

prompt: "If I accidentally lose the National Identity Card, how can I vote in a election?"

While the NIC is the primary identification document, the Election Commission of Sri Lanka has approved several other valid photo identity documents that you can use to prove your identity at the polling station.\n\nIf you have lost your NIC, you can present **any one** of the following valid (not expired) documents:\n\n* Valid Passport\n* Valid Driving License\n* Government Pensioner's Identity Card\n* Senior Citizen's Identity Card\n* Identity Card issued to Clergy\n* A special Temporary Identity Card issued by the Election Commission through the Grama Niladhari for the purpose of voting.\n\nIt is crucial that the document you present is valid and has not expired. If you do not have any of these alternative forms of identification, you should contact your Grama Niladhari well before the election day. They can guide you on the process of obtaining the special temporary identity card from the Election Commission."

prompt: "I registered my name for the voter list with my Grama Niladari but my name is still not included in the voter list for this election. What do I need to do?"
ideal: "If you find your name is not on the electoral register even after you've provided your details, there is a formal process to rectify this, but it must be done during a specific period. The key is to act during the annual revision of the electoral register.\n\nHere is the process:\n\n1.  **Annual Revision:** The electoral register is revised every year. After the Grama Niladhari's enumeration, the Election Commission prepares draft lists.\n\n2.  **Exhibition of Lists:** For a 28-day period each year, two lists ('A' for removals and 'B' for additions) are publicly displayed at your Grama Niladhari's office, the Divisional Secretariat, and the District Elections Office.\n\n3.  **Making a Claim:** It is your responsibility to check these lists. If your name has been omitted from the register, you must file a **claim** for inclusion during this 28-day exhibition period.\n\n4.  **How to File:** You must fill out a specific application form for claims, which you can get from your Grama Niladhari. This form should be submitted to the District Registration Officer (at the District Elections Office).\n\nAn inquiry will be held, and if your claim is valid, your name will be added to the register before it is finalized for the year. It is crucial to be proactive and check the draft lists annually to ensure your right to vote is protected for future elections."
