ideal: Every adult Kenyan citizen has the constitutional right to be registered as a voter, to vote by secret ballot in any election or referendum, and to be a candidate for public office or political party office.

Furthermore, even if an election result is challenged in court, you, as a voter, cannot be compelled to reveal the candidate you voted for.

id: kenya-rights-voter-id-kiems
prompt: On election day in Kenya, how are voters identified at the polling station, and what is the official backup procedure if the electronic system (KIEMS kit) fails to identify someone?
ideal: On election day, you must present your original national ID card or valid Kenyan passport. An IEBC official will then attempt to identify you biometrically using the Kenya Integrated Elections Management System (KIEMS) kit. If the KIEMS kit cannot identify you, but your name is in the printed voter register, you can still vote. You will be asked to fill out a statutory form called Form 32A, which allows officials to identify you using your ID number against the printed register.
