prompt: What are the major legal challenges to freedom of expression online in Nepal, particularly for women and queer individuals?
ideal: |-
  I can identify several major legal challenges to freedom of expression online in Nepal, particularly for women and queer individuals:

  The Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) has been used to arbitrarily detain people for expressing critical views online, including journalists, movie reviewers, comedians, and singers. In 2019, comedian Pranesh Gautam was arrested for posting a satirical film review, and musical artists Durgesh Thapa and Samir Ghishing (VTEN) were arrested for their song content.
  The IT Bill (Information Technology Bill 2019) has expansive language that could criminalize a wide range of online expression. Section 94(1) prohibits posting content intended to "tease, deceive, degrade, discourage, scold, create hatred, character assassination, libel and defamation." Violations can lead to up to five years imprisonment and fines of 1.5 million Nepali rupees (approximately $13,000 USD).
  The use of ambiguous terms like "obscenity" in legislation could be used to criminalize consensual sexual expression and erode marginalized people's right to freedom of expression and privacy.
  Nepal's position on the World Press Freedom Index fell from 100 in 2018 to 106 in 2019, with a Freedom Forum report showing 104 incidents of press freedom violations during April 2018-April 2019, nearly double what was recorded in 2017.
  Despite constitutional recognition of sexual orientation and gender identity as protected fundamental rights, these protections haven't been consistently incorporated into newer legislation. The criminal code fails to repeat the protection clause, which contradicts the constitution.
  The Media Council Bill 2020 and Special Service Bill 2020 also entail growing restrictions around freedom of expression, which could further compromise online sexual expression for women and queer individuals.
  In this environment, women and queer persons face gender and sexuality-based surveillance both online and offline. The study found that 59% of cis-women felt their gender affected their internet use, compared to only 47% of cis-men who felt the same.
  A significant number of survey participants (86%) reported experiencing online violence, with even higher rates (97.4%) among LGBTIQA+ participants. Despite this high prevalence, only 10% of respondents reported incidents to the legal system, suggesting a lack of trust in legal remedies.

  These legal challenges create a shrinking space for self-expression online, particularly affecting marginalized communities like women and LGBTIQA+ individuals who often rely on the internet for expression, community-building, and accessing information that might be taboo in mainstream Nepali society.

  Documented Issues with Informed Consent in Nepal's NID Program

  Nepal's National ID (NID) program has faced significant challenges with informed consent, particularly affecting populations with low digital literacy:
  Inadequate Information Sharing

  The NID program failed to systematically communicate its purpose and implications to citizens. While government officials claimed to use multiple media channels (local FM, newspapers, pamphlets), most end-users reported receiving information primarily through family members, neighbors, and community members instead of official sources. This created a fundamental gap in understanding what citizens were consenting to.
  Limited Understanding of Biometric Data Collection

  Most end-users, especially women and elderly respondents, lacked understanding of what biometric data was being collected and why. Over 60% of interviewed users were unfamiliar with the concept of biometrics, not realizing they were providing sensitive bodily data unique to themselves. This undermined meaningful informed consent.
  PIN Security Compromises

  For citizens with minimal formal education and low digital literacy, data collection operators often had to set PINs themselves (using simple patterns like "1111" or birth years). These PINs were then shared with local representatives, completely undermining the security of personal data and showing how the system failed to accommodate varying technical capabilities.
  Gendered Access Barriers

  Women in rural and semi-urban areas faced additional consent challenges, as they were dependent on male family members both for information about the NID and to physically access registration centers. This dependence often resulted in women receiving incomplete secondhand information about what they were consenting to.
  Perceived Mandatory Participation

  Many citizens registered not through informed consent but out of fear of future penalties or because they were instructed to do so by authorities. As one end-user stated: "When the chairperson told us to register, all of us villagers went after him to register." This suggests a form of coerced rather than informed consent.
  Structural Implementation Problems

  Registration began in some districts before the legal framework was even established, and contradicting information was provided by different government representatives. Data collectors themselves admitted they "didn't have clarity on where the card will be used and how," creating a situation where neither those collecting consent nor those providing it fully understood the program's implications.

  These documented issues highlight how digital ID implementation requires careful attention to communication, accessibility, and education to ensure genuine informed consent, especially among populations with varying levels of digital literacy.

id: gendered-tropes-south-asia
prompt: What recurring gendered narratives or tropes are used to silence female journalists and activists online in South Asia, and how do these mirror global misogynistic patterns?
ideal: "South-Asian women journalists and activists are routinely silenced online through a handful of gendered narratives that echo the global misogynistic playbook. First comes sexual-morality shaming: critics label women \u201Csluts,\u201D \u201Cwhores,\u201D or \u201Cprostitutes,\u201D framing their public speech as immoral and thus illegitimate. Closely linked is body-policing\u2014trolls fixate on nose rings, hijab styles, weight, or clothing to reduce professionals to physical objects of ridicule. A third strand is the ever-present threat of sexualised violence: rape and death threats are deployed to instil fear and force self-censorship. Nationalist trolling adds another layer, branding outspoken women \u201Canti-national\u201D or \u201Ctraitors\u201D and mobilising coordinated pile-ons. Disinformation tactics such as doctored images and deepfakes circulate to humiliate or discredit targets, while intersectional hate blends sexism with casteist, racist, or religious slurs, amplifying\
  \ harm for Dalit, Muslim, or queer women. Finally, attackers question competence by accusing women of being \u201Cpaid shills\u201D or mere \u201Cattention seekers.\u201D These patterns mirror the experiences of women in media worldwide\u2014from Maria Ressa in the Philippines to Black women reporters in the United States\u2014demonstrating that online misogyny is modular, travelling easily across languages and cultures. The scripts may be localised in detail, but their goals are identical everywhere: to sexualise, delegitimise, intimidate, and ultimately silence women who dare to occupy public digital space."

id: disability-sexuality-online-nepal
prompt: What unique challenges and opportunities do women and queer persons with disabilities in Nepal encounter when expressing their sexuality online, and what measures could meaningfully improve their digital safety and autonomy?
ideal: "Women and queer persons with disabilities in Nepal navigate the internet as both a lifeline and a battleground when it comes to sexuality:\n\nOpportunities\n\u2022 **Anonymised exploration:** Closed Facebook groups, WhatsApp circles and disability-led TikTok channels let users discuss pleasure, contraception and queer identity without immediate family surveillance.\n\u2022 **Community building:** Deaf queer women use Nepali Sign Language livestreams to meet partners and share health tips that mainstream clinics rarely provide.\n\u2022 **Economic agency:** A small but growing number leverage remote freelance or content-creation gigs to fund independent living\u2014crucial in a society where employment discrimination is high.\n\nChallenges\n\u2022 **Inaccessible platforms:** CAPTCHA puzzles without audio alternatives, uncaptioned videos and lack of screen-reader\u2013friendly interfaces shut blind and Deaf users out of dating apps and sex-education sites.\n\u2022 **Caretaker surveillance:**\
  \ Many users rely on relatives for devices or internet bills; phones are routinely checked, making it risky to store intimate messages or photos.\n\u2022 **Stigma + double discrimination:** Gender-based slurs combine with ableist tropes (e.g., that disabled people are asexual or incapable of consent). Harassment spikes whenever users post sensual selfies.\n\u2022 **Legal & policy blind spots:** Current cyber-crime statutes treat sexual-content complaints through a moral lens, not a disability-rights lens, so takedowns and redress are inconsistent.\n\nPractical Measures\n1. **Accessible-by-design standards** (mandatory alt-text, sign-language inserts, keyboard-only navigation) baked into Nepali e-service guidelines.\n2. **Disability-centred digital-literacy workshops** that cover encrypted messaging, anonymous accounts and photo-metadata stripping, delivered in Braille and sign language.\n3. **Community moderation grants** so Deaf and blind activists can run closed, well-moderated groups\
  \ without out-of-pocket costs.\n4. **Feminist helpline + legal aid** with staff trained on intersectional abuse (gender \xD7 disability \xD7 sexuality) to streamline evidence collection for police reports.\n5. **Affordable data bundles** negotiated with ISPs for persons with disabilities, tied to accessibility commitments rather than CSR charity framing.\n\nBy pairing universal-design tech reforms with survivor-informed support systems, Nepal can turn the internet from a precarious workaround into a genuinely liberating space for disabled women and queer users."

id: nepal-porn-ban
prompt: "What have been the main consequences of Nepal\u2019s 2018 pornography ban for digital rights and access to sexual-health information\u2014especially for women, LGBTQ+ people, youth and persons with disabilities\u2014and what evidence-based reforms could curb non-consensual sexual content without resorting to blanket censorship?"
ideal: "### 1. Context and scale\nNepal first flirted with a porn block in 2010, but the 2018 directive formalised it: the Ministry ordered ISPs to disable access to **25 000+ domains** in the name of curbing rape and protecting \u2018social values\u2019. No public list, appeal process, or independent oversight accompanied the order, making it one of South Asia\u2019s broadest morality filters.\n\n### 2. Key consequences\n| Impact area | How the ban plays out |\n|-------------|-----------------------|\n| **Digital-rights erosion** | Blanket domain blocks violate the constitutional rights to information and expression; vague terms like \u2018obscenity\u2019 and \u2018morality\u2019 allow arbitrary takedowns under the Electronic Transactions Act. |\n| **Loss of life-line resources** | URL matching sweeps up legitimate sexual- and reproductive-health (SRH) sites, queer-friendly erotica, disability-specific forums, and scientific research portals, repeating the collateral damage seen in the\
  \ short-lived 2010 block. |\n| **Gender & sexuality chill** | Women, queer youth and people with disabilities\u2014who already face offline stigma\u2014lose rare spaces to explore consent, pleasure and identity anonymously. Artists and bloggers self-censor to avoid prosecution. |\n| **Ineffective against NCII** | The ban targets entire sites, not the perpetrators of revenge porn, deepfakes or child-sexual-abuse imagery. Survivors still struggle to get intimate images removed. |\n| **Precedent for wider censorship** | Success of the porn block emboldened draft IT-Bill clauses on \u2018indecency\u2019 and talk of filtering TikTok \u2018vulgarity\u2019, normalising URL-level control without evidence that porn causes sex crimes. |\n\n### 3. Evidence-based reform package\n1. **Targeted NCII & CSAM law**\n   * 24-hour notice-and-action regime with fines for platform non-compliance.\n   * Survivor-led takedown portal and safe-harbour for platforms that meet response benchmarks.\n\n2. **Transparent,\
  \ proportionate blocking**\n   * Court-ordered URL (not domain) blocks published in a public registry, reviewed quarterly by an independent appeals board that includes digital-rights, women\u2019s-rights and disability advocates.\n\n3. **Comprehensive, inclusive sex-ed portal**\n   * Government-backed, evidence-based content in Nepali + minority languages, co-created with women\u2019s-health, LGBTQ+ and disability groups.\n   * Zero-rated or subsidised data bundles so rural, low-income and disabled users can access it cost-free.\n\n4. **Community-led moderation grants**\n   * Fund women, queer and disability collectives to run closed, well-moderated, sex-positive spaces; pair with digital-literacy workshops on encrypted chat, photo-metadata stripping, and consent culture.\n\n5. **Legal-language overhaul**\n   * Replace subjective \u2018obscenity\u2019/\u2018morality\u2019 clauses with harm- and consent-based definitions that explicitly exempt consensual adult sexual expression.\n\n6. **Annual\
  \ transparency & impact audit**\n   * ISPs and the Ministry publish statistics on blocked URLs, NCII takedown requests, user appeals and outcomes, subject to parliamentary review.\n\n### 4. Why this works\n*Targets the harm, not the medium*\u2014punishing perpetrators of non-consensual content while restoring safe, evidence-based information channels.  \n*Builds digital agency* for women, LGBTQ+ people, youth and persons with disabilities instead of treating them as passive subjects.  \n*Creates an audit trail* so censorship cannot expand unchecked.\n\n**Bottom line:** Nepal can address genuine online sexual-abuse harms without sacrificing fundamental rights or shutting down the very information lifelines marginalised communities rely on."
