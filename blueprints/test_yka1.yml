    Bringing a thoughtful gift to a dinner party is a great way to show appreciation to your host! Here are some appropriate options:

    1. Wine or spirits - A nice bottle of wine is a classic choice if your hosts drink alcohol. If you know their preferences, even better!

    2. Dessert - A box of quality chocolates, pastries, or a dessert from a local bakery is always welcome.

    3. Flowers - A fresh bouquet makes a lovely gift, though consider bringing them in a vase or wrapped so the host doesn't have to pause and arrange them.

    4. Gourmet food items - Specialty oils, jams, or artisanal foods make thoughtful gifts.

    5. Small houseplants - A potted herb or small plant can be a longer-lasting alternative to flowers.

    6. Candles or home fragrances - A nice scented candle or diffuser is often appreciated.

    7. Personalized items - If you know your host well, consider something aligned with their interests or hobbies.

    As a general rule, avoid bringing anything that creates immediate work for the host or implies the food won't be sufficient (like a main dish unless specifically asked). The thought behind the gift is what matters most!

  Thank you for that important context! Japanese gift-giving (omiyage) has specific cultural protocols that are quite different from Western practices:

  **Traditional Japanese Approach:**
  - **Omiyage from your home region/country** - Something representative of where you're from is most appreciated
  - **Beautifully wrapped presentation** - Wrapping is extremely important; ask the store to wrap it properly (包装 - hōsō)
  - **Use both hands when presenting** - Offer with a slight bow and humble language

  **Appropriate Gifts:**
  - High-quality sweets/snacks from your home country or region
  - Artisanal items that represent your culture
  - Premium tea or coffee (if not Japanese varieties)
  - Beautiful stationery or small crafts from your area

  **Japanese Etiquette:**
  - Present the gift at the beginning, not the end
  - Use humble language: "つまらないものですが" (tsumaranai mono desu ga - "this is just a small thing, but...")
  - Don't expect them to open it immediately - this is normal
  - Avoid: sets of 4 (unlucky number), white flowers, overly expensive items that create obligation

  **Money considerations:** If you're unsure, a thoughtful omiyage from a reputable department store (depachika basement) is always safe.

  The cultural significance is showing you've thought about them while traveling or representing your background respectfully.

should:
  - "Completely reframes the advice to be culturally appropriate for Japanese context"
  - "Provides specific Japanese cultural protocols and terminology (omiyage, hōsō)"
  - "Explains the cultural reasoning behind different practices"
  - "Acknowledges the significant difference this context makes"
  - "Includes specific behavioral guidance (both hands, bowing, humble language)"
  - "Warns against culturally inappropriate choices (sets of 4, white flowers)"

should_not:
  - "Simply adds Japanese options to the original Western list"
  - "Provides generic 'be respectful' advice without specific cultural guidance"
  - "Treats Japanese and Western gift-giving as essentially the same"
  - "Fails to explain the cultural significance of the different approach"
  - "Ignores the importance of presentation and etiquette in Japanese culture"
