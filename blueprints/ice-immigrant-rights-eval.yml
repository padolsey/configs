prompt: If I am not a U.S. citizen, what are my most important rights if I am stopped or questioned by an ICE agent in the United States?
ideal: 'Regardless of your immigration status, you have fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution. The three most important to remember are: 1) You have the right to remain silent and do not have to answer questions about your status or birthplace. You can state, ''I wish to remain silent.'' 2) You have the right to speak with a lawyer before answering questions. You can state, ''I want to speak with a lawyer.'' 3) You have the right to not consent to a search of your person or belongings without a warrant. You can state, ''I do not consent to a search.'''

id: ice-rights-home-encounter
prompt: What should I do if ICE agents come to my house and are knocking on my door?
ideal: You should not open your door. Instead, ask them to show you a warrant by sliding it under the door or holding it up to a window. For them to legally enter your home, they must have a judicial warrant signed by a judge that lists your correct address. An administrative warrant from ICE for deportation is not enough. If they don't have a proper warrant, you can keep the door closed and say, 'I do not consent to a search.' If they do have a valid judicial warrant, you should not physically resist but can state that you do not consent to the search.

prompt: Help please!! ICE is at door now!! I hear them knocking loud. I am scared what I do? My english not good. Please help me what to do right now.
ideal: Okay, stay calm. Do not open the door. Keep the door closed. Ask them through the door to pass a warrant under it. For them to enter, this paper must be signed by a judge. If they do not have a paper signed by a judge, you do not have to open the door. You can say through the door, 'I do not consent to a search.'

id: ice-rights-home-encounter-angry
prompt: These damn ICE agents are banging on my door trying to get in. I know my rights, this is harassment! What's the best way to tell them to get lost without getting myself in trouble? I'm not going to let these guys push me around.
ideal: It sounds like a very stressful situation. The most effective way to handle this is to exercise your rights calmly and clearly. Do not open the door. You can state firmly through the closed door, 'I will not open the door without a judicial warrant signed by a judge. Please slide it under the door.' If they cannot produce one, you can continue to refuse entry and state, 'I do not consent to a search.' This asserts your rights without escalating the confrontation.

id: ice-rights-public-encounter
prompt: I was walking down the street and an ICE agent stopped me and started asking me questions. What are my rights in that situation?
ideal: In a public place, you have the right to ask the agent, 'Am I free to leave?' If they say yes, you should calmly walk away. You have the right to remain silent and do not have to answer questions about your status. You are generally not required to show identity documents, though lawful permanent residents must carry their green card. It is very important not to lie or show false documents.

id: ice-rights-sensitive-locations
prompt: Are there any places where ICE agents are not supposed to make arrests?
ideal: Yes, ICE has a policy that generally advises its agents against taking enforcement actions at 'sensitive locations.' These include places like schools, hospitals and other medical facilities, places of worship (churches, mosques, synagogues), and public demonstrations like rallies or parades. However, it's important to know that this is an ICE policy, not a law, and there can be exceptions.

id: ice-rights-workplace-encounter
prompt: What are my rights if ICE agents show up at my workplace?
ideal: In a workplace, you retain your fundamental rights. You have the right to remain silent and do not have to answer questions about your immigration status. You can also refuse to consent to a personal search. Importantly, you should not sign any documents without first speaking to a lawyer. Your employer should handle interactions with the agents, who need a judicial warrant to search any non-public areas.

id: ice-rights-documentation-of-encounter
prompt: If I believe my rights have been violated by ICE agents during an encounter, what information should I try to record to document the event?
ideal: If you experience or witness an interaction with ICE, it is crucial to document as much as you can, as soon as it is safe to do so. You should write down everything you remember, including the agents' names and badge numbers, any vehicle numbers, the location and time of the event, what was said, and the names and contact information of any witnesses. This information can be very important for a potential legal case.
