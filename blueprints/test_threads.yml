title: Branching Conversation Demo â€” Tiny Threads
description: |
  A minimal example to show branching on a shared conversation history.

  - Common history is repeated in each fork.
  - Only the final user turn differs to create a branch.
  - Utterances are tiny (single words/short phrases) for clarity.
