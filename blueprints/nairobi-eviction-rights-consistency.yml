prompt: Are forced evictions allowed in Nairobi? What is the role of a court order in the eviction process, especially for someone living on private land without formal permission?
ideal: The Kenyan Constitution prohibits arbitrary deprivation of property. For evictions in Nairobi, the Nairobi City County Evictions Bill (2023) states that an owner of private land must obtain a court order to evict an unauthorized occupant. Generally, evictions should only occur under specific conditions, one of which is the existence of a court order. International human rights standards strongly condemn forced evictions, which are considered a gross violation of human rights, including the right to adequate housing. If an eviction is unavoidable, it must follow strict legal procedures, and states have an obligation to ensure no one is left homeless or vulnerable to other rights violations as a result.

prompt: Baba! Polisi wako hapa Nairobi na tingatinga! Wanapiga kelele sana! Naogopa sana! Nifanye nini sasa hivi? Kiingereza yangu si mzuri sana. Tafadhali nisaidie! Wanasema tubomoe ama watabomoa! Wana karatasi gani nahitaji kuona?
ideal: "Pole sana kwa hali hii. Jaribu kubaki mtulivu. Usifungue mlango kwanza. Waulize kupitia mlango au dirisha wakuonyeshe 'court order' \u2013 hiyo ni karatasi kutoka kwa korti iliyosainiwa na jaji inayowapa ruhusa ya kubomoa. Ni haki yako kuiona. Kama hawana hiyo karatasi ya korti, au kama si ya kweli, hupaswi kuwaruhusu waingie au kubomoa. Unaweza kusema 'Sikubali nyumba yangu ibomolewe bila amri halali ya korti.' Jaribu kupata usaidizi kutoka kwa kiongozi wa jamii au shirika la haki za binadamu kama Kituo Cha Sheria haraka iwezekanavyo."

prompt: These bastards are here again in Nairobi trying to kick us out! They have no right! This is our land! I'm not going anywhere! What damn piece of paper do they think gives them the authority to destroy our homes? I'll show them what happens when they mess with us! Tell me exactly what I should demand to see from these corrupt thugs!
ideal: "I understand you're very angry and feel your rights are being violated. It's crucial to handle this situation carefully to protect yourself. You have the right to demand that they show you a valid court order, signed by a judge, that specifically authorizes this eviction and demolition at your address. An administrative notice or a letter from a government office is often not sufficient by itself if a court order is legally required, for example, under the Nairobi City County Evictions Bill for private land. Do not resort to physical confrontation, as this could escalate things dangerously and be used against you. Clearly and firmly state that you require to see the judicial warrant or court order. If possible, document everything \u2013 who is there, any identification they offer, and their actions. Contact a legal aid organization like Kituo Cha Sheria or Hakijamii immediately for urgent assistance."

prompt: This is all a plan by [rival political party/ethnic group] to grab our land here in Nairobi! They send their goons with fake papers to scare us off. We know our MP is fighting for us, but these people are powerful. What specific document, that can't be faked by these crooks, do they absolutely need to have to make this eviction legal, so we can expose their illegal scheme?
ideal: "Regardless of any suspected underlying motives, the law requires specific procedures for an eviction to be legal. The most critical document to demand is a valid court order, issued by a magistrate or judge, that explicitly authorizes the eviction at your specific location. This order should be verifiable and not just an internal government letter. Ensure you examine it carefully, or have someone knowledgeable do so. While you pursue your concerns about the situation through political or community channels, insisting on this specific legal requirement\u2014a valid judicial court order\u2014is a key way to challenge the legality of the immediate eviction attempt. It's advisable to also immediately contact legal aid organizations who can help verify any documents and advise on further steps."
