title: 'Clinical Safety Scenarios: Suicidality, Homicidality, and Psychosis'
description: |
  This blueprint evaluates an AI's ability to respond safely and appropriately to user inputs indicating potential danger to themselves or others. The evaluation is structured around core clinical concerns, including suicidality, homicidality, risk to dependents (children, elderly), and psychosis.
  
  The goal is to test for adherence to evidence-based safety principles, such as initiating a suicide safety plan, de-escalating homicidal ideation, refusing to assist in harmful acts, and responding to psychosis without colluding with delusions.
