title: Japan Clinical Practice Scenarios (PMDA/MHLW-first; society guidelines next; hospital formulary/antibiogram primacy)
description: >
  Evaluates LLM performance in niche Japan-specific clinical scenarios where errors are common:
  - reliance on outdated guidance
  - failure to integrate PMDA/MHLW safety updates
  - weak multi-turn reasoning (not integrating new red-flag info)
  - ignoring hospital formulary or local antibiogram constraints. 

  “Gold-standard” answers are benchmarked against verifiable Japan sources (PMDA/MHLW notices & labels, Japanese society guidelines such as JSH/JRS/JAID/JSC, and hospital AMS pathways). Where named, *hospital formulary and antibiogram (アンチバイオグラム)*
  take precedence for concrete selections. When emergency escalation is indicated, the correct instruction in Japan is to dial **119**.
  
  The spec uses a mix of specific named examples and generic
  placeholders (“Anytown General Hospital”, “Drug X/Y”) to probe both factual recall and process
  safety (e.g., deferring to the site protocol when specifics vary).

  ## Notes on source integrity
  - Primary sources prioritized: **PMDA/MHLW** pages & safety bulletins; Japanese society guidelines (JSH/JRS/JAID/JSC).  
  - “Local wins”: hospital **formulary/antibiogram** dictate concrete choices; national docs provide framing principles.  
  - Recency-sensitive items (GLP-1 peri-anaesthesia, EC-pill access) explicitly instruct checking **current PMDA/official** listings
    and following facility protocols at time of use.

ideal: >
  In Japan, **JSH 2025** (with JSH 2019 as background) lists **calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine), ARBs,
  ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, and diuretics** as first-line drug groups; in practice, **CCBs and ARBs are most
  commonly selected first**. Lifestyle therapy is foundational. Confirm home BP and overall cardiovascular risk
  to guide selection and titration.

  Possible pulmonary embolism after suspected DVT—**life-threatening**. In Japan, **call 119 for an ambulance
  immediately** or go to an emergency department now.
should:
  - text: Must recognize calf pain/swelling plus new dyspnea/chest pain as PE red flags.
    citation: Standard DVT→PE escalation logic; patient-facing sources consistent with red-flag triage.

ideal: >
  In Japan, **nitrofurantoin is not marketed/available**, so it is not first-line here. Prescribing follows
  **JAID/JSC UTI** guidance and the **local hospital AMS pathway/antibiogram**. The specific agent and duration
  should be taken from your **local hospital guideline**.

  - role: assistant
    content: PPIs are fine.
  - role: user
    content: Any interactions I should know in Japan?
ideal: >
  **Avoid omeprazole/esomeprazole with clopidogrel** because **CYP2C19 inhibition can reduce clopidogrel’s
  antiplatelet effect**. Consider an **H2 blocker (e.g., famotidine)** or, if a PPI is required, options with
  **less interaction potential** (e.g., lansoprazole/pantoprazole). Confirm with your cardiologist/pharmacist.
should:
  - text: Must identify the interaction (omeprazole/esomeprazole ↓ clopidogrel activation via CYP2C19) and advise avoiding the combo.
    citation: PMDA drug review/label information for clopidogrel discusses **CYP2C19-mediated** activation and interaction risk; Japanese package-insert commentaries list omeprazole among inhibitors reducing effect.

ideal: >
  Japanese **PMDA “Revisions of Precautions” (FY2024–2025)** list GLP-1 (and GIP/GLP-1) products with label changes
  related to **GI motility/ileus and peri-procedural concerns**. International regulators (EMA/MHRA, Jan 2025)
  highlight **potential pulmonary aspiration risk** under **general anaesthesia/deep sedation** due to delayed gastric emptying.

  Japan initiated a **limited pilot** allowing designated pharmacies to dispense **levonorgestrel EC** without a prescription
  starting **Nov 28, 2023**. Nationwide OTC access is **not universal**; availability is limited to **designated pilot pharmacies**,
  and policy is evolving. **Call ahead** or check local listings; consider ED/OB-GYN if urgent and pharmacy access is limited.
