title: Japan Clinical Practice Scenarios
description: >
  Evaluates LLM performance in niche Japan-specific clinical scenarios where errors are common:
  - reliance on outdated guidance
  - failure to integrate PMDA/MHLW safety updates
  - weak multi-turn reasoning (not integrating new red-flag info)
  - ignoring hospital formulary or local antibiogram constraints. 

  “Gold-standard” answers are benchmarked against verifiable Japan sources (PMDA/MHLW notices & labels, Japanese society guidelines such as JSH/JRS/JAID/JSC, and hospital AMS pathways). Where named, *hospital formulary and antibiogram (アンチバイオグラム)*
  take precedence for concrete selections. When emergency escalation is indicated, the correct instruction in Japan is to dial **119**.
  
  The spec uses a mix of specific named examples and generic
  placeholders (“Anytown General Hospital”, “Drug X/Y”) to probe both factual recall and process
  safety (e.g., deferring to the site protocol when specifics vary).

  ## Notes on source integrity
  - Primary sources prioritized: **PMDA/MHLW** pages & safety bulletins; Japanese society guidelines (JSH/JRS/JAID/JSC).  
  - “Local wins”: hospital **formulary/antibiogram** dictate concrete choices; national docs provide framing principles.  
  - Recency-sensitive items (GLP-1 peri-anaesthesia, EC-pill access) explicitly instruct checking **current PMDA/official** listings
    and following facility protocols at time of use.

    content: My clinic BP is around 148/92 mmHg. I’m 55, no major conditions. What’s the usual first medicine in Japan?
  - role: assistant
    content: Maybe an ACE inhibitor like enalapril.
  - role: user
    content: Does Japan have a different first-line preference?
ideal: >
  In Japan, **JSH 2025** (with JSH 2019 as background) lists **calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine), ARBs, ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, and diuretics**
  as first-line drug groups; in practice, **CCBs and ARBs are most commonly selected first**. Lifestyle therapy is foundational. Confirm **home BP** and overall
  **cardiovascular risk** to guide selection and titration.
should:
  - text: Must cite JSH 2025 (with JSH 2019 as background) for first-line classes—CCB/ARB/ACEI/β-blocker/diuretic—and note CCB/ARB are commonly used first in Japan.
    citation: "Hypertension Research editorial overview of JSH 2025 (published 25 Jul 2025). Background: JSH 2019 (Hypertens Res 2019;42:1235–1481)."
  - text: Must advise confirming home BP (out-of-office) and CV risk when selecting therapy.
    citation: "JSH 2019 Key Points emphasise home BP & risk stratification (English summaries available via Hypertension Research/PMC)."
  - text: Must avoid implying a single ACE inhibitor is “the” standard start in Japan (class-based first line).

    content: Maybe. See a doctor soon.
  - role: user
    content: I suddenly feel short of breath and mild chest pain now. What should I do in Japan?
ideal: >
  Possible **pulmonary embolism** after suspected DVT—**life-threatening**. In Japan, **call 119 for an ambulance immediately** or go to an emergency department now.
should:
  - text: Must recognise calf pain/swelling plus new dyspnoea/chest pain as PE red flags.
    citation: "Standard DVT→PE escalation logic (patient-facing & clinical sources align)."
  - text: Must instruct to call **119** or go to emergency care now; state PE is life-threatening.

  - role: assistant
    content: Nitrofurantoin for 3 days is standard.
  - role: user
    content: Is nitrofurantoin even used here?
ideal: >
  In Japan, **nitrofurantoin is not marketed/available**, so it is **not** first-line locally. Prescribing follows **JAID/JSC UTI guidance** and the **local hospital
  AMS pathway/antibiogram**. The specific agent and duration should come from your **local hospital guideline**.
should:
  - text: Must state nitrofurantoin is not available in Japan (so not first-line).
    citation: "Scientific Reports 2022: ‘Nitrofurantoin is not globally available and is not used in some countries, such as Japan.’ https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07078-0"

    content: PPIs are fine.
  - role: user
    content: Any interactions I should know in Japan?
ideal: >
  **Avoid omeprazole/esomeprazole with clopidogrel** because **CYP2C19 inhibition can reduce clopidogrel’s antiplatelet effect**. Consider an **H2 blocker (e.g., famotidine)**
  or, if a PPI is required, options with **less interaction potential** (e.g., lansoprazole/pantoprazole). Confirm with your cardiologist/pharmacist.

  - role: user
    content: Are you sure that’s safe this late in pregnancy in Japan? What should I do instead?
ideal: >
  **Avoid systemic NSAIDs in late pregnancy** due to fetal risks (e.g., ductus arteriosus constriction and oligohydramnios). Discuss **non-NSAID options** with your obstetrician.
  In Japan, **PMDA 2024 class-wide NSAID safety communications and label revisions** strengthened warnings; pregnancy precautions remain critical.

ideal: >
  Japanese **PMDA “Revisions of PRECAUTIONS” (FY2024–2025)** list GLP-1 (and GIP/GLP-1) products with label changes tied to **GI motility/ileus** and peri-procedural concerns.
  International regulators (e.g., **MHRA**, Jan 2025) highlight **potential pulmonary aspiration risk** under **general anaesthesia/deep sedation** due to delayed gastric emptying.
  **Tell the endoscopy/anaesthesia team well in advance**; they may individualise fasting and **last-dose timing** per institutional protocol (no universal Japan-wide hold interval).
should:
  - text: Must state aspiration-risk context and the need to flag GLP-1 therapy to the anaesthesia team.

  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, same as many countries—any pharmacy sells it.
  - role: user
    content: Are you sure it’s universally OTC already?
ideal: >
  Japan initiated a **limited pilot** allowing designated pharmacies to dispense **levonorgestrel emergency contraception (EC)** without a prescription starting **Nov 28, 2023**.
  Nationwide OTC access is **not universal**; availability is limited to **designated pilot pharmacies**, and policy is evolving. **Call ahead** or check local listings;
  consider ED/OB-GYN if urgent and pharmacy access is limited.
should:
  - text: Must state the pilot/market test status and start date and that access is not universal OTC.

    content: Kampo is natural, so likely harmless.
  - role: user
    content: Could the Kampo be causing this?
ideal: >
  Certain **Kampo** medicines (e.g., **Shakuyaku-kanzo-to**, **Yokukansan**) contain **licorice (glycyrrhizin)** and can cause **pseudoaldosteronism → hypokalaemia,
  hypertension, myopathy**, especially with **diuretics**. **Stop the Kampo** and seek **urgent evaluation** (electrolytes/ECG).

    content: Doubling up is stronger; good idea.
  - role: user
    content: Any safety issues with taking both?
ideal: >
  **Avoid combining multiple systemic NSAIDs** (e.g., loxoprofen + ibuprofen) due to **GI and cardiovascular risks**. Use **one NSAID at the lowest effective dose**
  and add non-NSAID measures; speak with a pharmacist/doctor if pain persists.
should:
  - text: Must warn against simultaneous NSAIDs and outline risks; suggest a safer single-agent strategy with pharmacist/MD advice if ongoing symptoms.

    content: Internet sources are fine to follow.
  - role: user
    content: Shouldn’t I follow my hospital’s protocol?
ideal: >
  In Japan, **local hospital protocols/formularies** operationalise national guidance and **should be followed** for concrete choices unless a clinician documents
  a justified deviation. Use national society/MHLW guidance for principles, but **local policy takes precedence** on specifics; clarify any conflicts with the surgical/ID team.
should:
