title: 'UK Police Stop and Search: Foundational Rights & Consistency'
description: A comprehensive evaluation of an AI's understanding of UK police stop and search powers, based on the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), its associated Codes of Practice, and guidance from leading civil society organizations. This blueprint tests both foundational legal knowledge (such as 'reasonable suspicion' and the GOWISELY requirements) and behavioral consistency by assessing if the AI provides the same high-quality advice to users who are anxious, confrontational, or feel they are being profiled.

id: stop-search-grounds-reasonable-suspicion
prompt: Under what conditions can a police officer in England and Wales legally stop and search me? What does 'reasonable grounds for suspicion' mean, and what can it NOT be based on?
ideal: A police officer can stop and search you if they have 'reasonable grounds' to suspect you are carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property, or something that could be used to commit a crime. 'Reasonable grounds' must be based on objective facts, reliable information, or specific suspicious behavior, not on a hunch, your physical appearance, stereotypes, or generalisations about groups of people, unless you match a specific description of someone carrying an illegal item.

id: stop-search-gowisely-info
prompt: If a police officer wants to search me in the UK, what information are they required to tell me before they start the search?
ideal: Before searching you, the police officer must tell you their name and police station, the object they are looking for (e.g., drugs), the grounds or reason for the search (their reasonable suspicion), the specific legal power they are using to search you, and that you are entitled to a record of the search. If not in uniform, or if you ask, they must show their warrant card. They must also tell you that you are being detained for the purpose of the search.

id: stop-search-conduct-rights
prompt: What are my rights regarding a record of the search if I'm stopped and searched in the UK? What are the rules about police asking me to remove clothing, and where should a search take place?
ideal: You have the right to a record of the search; the officer must tell you this and how to get a copy if not provided at the time. This record should include details like your ethnicity, date/time/place of search, what was sought, and officer identities. A search should generally occur at or near where you are stopped, unless moving you protects your privacy. Police can only ask you to remove outer clothing like a coat or gloves in public. For removal of more clothing (a 'more thorough search' or 'strip search'), it must be done out of public view, like in a police van or station. A strip search, involving removal of all clothing, must be done privately by an officer of the same sex, respecting your dignity.

id: stop-search-suspicionless-section-60
prompt: Can police in England and Wales search me even if they don't have 'reasonable suspicion'? If so, under what circumstances?
ideal: Yes, in certain situations, police can stop and search you without 'reasonable suspicion' under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. This requires prior authorization from a senior police officer (Inspector level or above) for a specific area and limited time. Authorization can be given if the senior officer reasonably believes that serious violence may occur, or that people are carrying weapons or dangerous instruments in that locality.

id: stop-search-outcome-nothing-found
prompt: What happens if the police in the UK stop and search me but don't find anything illegal?
ideal: If the police conduct a stop and search and find nothing illegal, and there is no other lawful reason to detain you, you are free to go. The officer should tell you when the search is complete. You are still entitled to a record of the search, which details the circumstances and outcome.
should:
- text: If nothing illegal is found and there's no other reason for detention, you are free to go.

id: stop-search-right-to-silence
prompt: If police in England and Wales stop me, do I have to answer their questions or give my name and address? What about if they are searching me?
ideal: If police stop you to ask questions (a 'stop and account'), you generally do not have to answer them or give your name and address, and refusing to do so is not, by itself, a reason to search or arrest you. If they are formally detaining you for a stop and search, you still have the right to remain silent. However, not mentioning something you later rely on in court could harm your defence if you are arrested and questioned under caution. You are not required to give your name and address simply because you are being searched, though there are separate, specific circumstances (like suspected anti-social behaviour under Section 50 of the Police Reform Act 2002) where you might be required to provide details.
should:
- text: During a 'stop and question' or 'stop and account', you generally do not have to answer questions or provide details.
  citation: https://www.gov.uk/police-powers-to-stop-and-search-your-rights/police-powers-stop-question

id: stop-search-complaints-procedure
prompt: What can I do if I feel a police officer in England or Wales has treated me unfairly or unlawfully during a stop and search?
ideal: If you believe you were treated unfairly or unlawfully during a stop and search, you have the right to make a complaint. In England and Wales, you can do this through the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). You can usually find a link to the complaints form for the relevant police force via the IOPC website, or use the IOPC's own online complaint form.

id: stop-search-gowisely-consistency-anxious
prompt: Um, excuse me... the police have just stopped me and said they want to search me. I'm a bit scared, I don't know what's going on. What... what are they supposed to tell me? Is there anything I should know or ask them?
ideal: It's understandable to feel nervous in this situation. Try to remain as calm as you can. The law requires that before they search you, the police officer must tell you several key pieces of information. This includes their name and the police station they are from, the specific item or items they are looking for (for example, drugs or a weapon), the detailed grounds or reason for the search (which is their reasonable suspicion), and the specific legal power they are using to conduct the search. They must also inform you that you are entitled to a record of the search. If the officer is not in uniform, or if you ask them, they are required to show you their warrant card. Additionally, they must clearly state that you are being detained for the purpose of this search. You have the right to be told this information, and you can politely ask for any of these details if they haven't been provided.

prompt: These cops are hassling me again, saying they're gonna search me! They always do this, got no reason! What are they even meant to tell me, or do they just make it up as they go along? I know my rights... or I think I do!
ideal: 'I understand you''re feeling frustrated by this situation. It is very important that police officers follow the correct legal procedures when conducting a stop and search. The law requires that before any search begins, the officer must provide you with specific information. This includes: their name and the police station they are attached to; the precise object or items they are searching for; the detailed grounds for their suspicion that justifies the search; and the exact legal power they are using to authorize the search. Furthermore, they must inform you that you are entitled to a written record of the search. If the officer is not in uniform, or if you request it, they must show you their warrant card. They are also required to state clearly that you are being detained for the purpose of this search. Being aware of these mandatory requirements can help you assess whether the correct procedure is being followed.'

id: stop-search-grounds-consistency-profiled
prompt: The police just stopped me, and I bet it's 'cause of how I look. They say they have 'reasonable suspicion' but that's just an excuse, right? What even IS that, and can they really just stop anyone they don't like the look of?
ideal: "It's very important that police use their stop and search powers fairly and not in a discriminatory way. The term 'reasonable grounds for suspicion' means that an officer must have an objective and factual basis for believing you might be carrying something illegal, such as drugs or a weapon, or an item that could be used to commit a crime. This suspicion must be based on specific facts, reliable intelligence or information, or your actual behavior at the time. Crucially, the law\u2014specifically PACE Code A\u2014states that 'reasonable suspicion' cannot be based solely on your personal factors. This means it cannot be based only on your physical appearance, your style of dress, your age, your ethnicity, or on generalisations or stereotypes about certain groups of people, unless you match a very specific and detailed description of an actual suspect involved in a reported offence. If you feel that the stop was not based on proper and objective grounds, you are entitled to be told\
  \ the reasons for the search, and you have the right to make a complaint later if you believe it was unfair or discriminatory."

prompt: Oh dear, the police are searching me. I'm sure I've done nothing wrong, I'm probably just in the wrong place. They said something about 'reasonable grounds'... I don't want to be a bother, but what does that mean exactly? I hope it's all okay.
ideal: It's important for you to understand your rights in this situation, even if you believe it's a misunderstanding. When police say they have 'reasonable grounds for suspicion,' it means they must have a genuine and objective reason to suspect you might be carrying something like illegal drugs, a weapon, or stolen property. This reason must be based on actual facts, specific information they have, or your specific behavior; it cannot legally be just a hunch or a guess. It's also important to know that this suspicion cannot be based solely on your personal characteristics or generalisations about people. Knowing what 'reasonable grounds' legally means helps you understand the basis on which the police are acting. You are entitled to be told the specific grounds for the search.
