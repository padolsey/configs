# Weval Evaluation Blueprints

This repository is the heart of Weval's evaluation content. It serves as the central, community-driven store for all **evaluation blueprints** used by the [Weval platform](https://weval.org) and its [core application](https://github.com/weval-org/app). The automated Weval system fetches blueprints from this repository to perform periodic and on-demand evaluations of language models.

## Our Mission & Your Contribution

Weval is an independent, open-source evaluation suite designed to act as a **public-interest watchdog for artificial intelligence**. It moves beyond asking "Is this model smart?" to ask, "Is this model a responsible, safe and harm-reducing actor in our society?"

We invite you to contribute blueprints that align with this mission. While the underlying Weval framework can support a wide range of qualitative evaluations, the blueprints hosted in *this* repository should focus on these civic-minded areas:

*   **Testing Nuanced, High-Stakes Scenarios:** Evaluating models in areas where failure could cause public harm (e.g., human rights, mental health crises).
*   **Assessing Critical Thinking and Skepticism:** Testing a model's ability to identify and resist manipulation, misinformation, and loaded questions.
*   **Upholding the Rule of Law and Core Democratic Processes**
*   **Promoting Anti-discrimination Principles**

Your contributions help us build a comprehensive, open-source resource for understanding how AI models perform on issues that matter to us all.

## Weval Blueprint Format

This document provides a comprehensive guide to creating evaluation blueprints for the Weval suite. Blueprints are configuration files that define a set of prompts, models to test, and the criteria for evaluating the models' responses.

All blueprints contributed to the public repository at [github.com/weval-org/configs](https://github.com/weval-org/configs) are dedicated to the public domain via Creative Commons Zero (CC0).

While the system maintains support for a legacy JSON format, the recommended and most user-friendly format is **YAML**.

---

### YAML Blueprint Format (Recommended)

Our YAML format is designed for clarity and ease of contribution, especially for non-technical users. It can be structured in a few flexible ways.

#### Blueprint Structures

The system can parse YAML blueprints in three main structures:

**1. Config Header + Prompts (Multi-Document)**

This is the recommended structure for most blueprints. The first YAML document contains the global configuration, and the second document contains the list of prompts. The two are separated by a `---` line.

```yaml
# Configuration Header (First YAML Document)
id: my-blueprint-v1
title: "My First Blueprint"
models:
  - openai:gpt-4o-mini
---
# List of Prompts (Second YAML Document)
- id: p1
  prompt: "What is the capital of France?"
- id: p2
  prompt: "What is 2 + 2?"
```

**2. Stream of Prompt Documents**

For simple blueprints that don't need a global configuration header, you can provide a stream of individual prompt objects, each separated by `---`. The blueprint's `id` and `title` will be automatically derived from its filename.

```yaml
# Each prompt is its own YAML document
prompt: "First prompt"
ideal: "An ideal response for the first prompt."
---
prompt: "Second prompt"
should:
  - "The second prompt should do this."
  - "And also this."
---
prompt: "Third prompt"
```

**3. List of Prompts Only (Single Document)**

You can also provide a single YAML document that is just a list of prompt objects. This is functionally equivalent to the "Stream of Prompt Documents" structure and is also ideal for simple, header-less blueprints.

```yaml
# A single YAML document containing a list of prompts
- prompt: "What are the three primary colors?"
- prompt: "What is the square root of 16?"
```

**4. Single-Document with `prompts` key**

For consistency with the JSON format, you can define the entire blueprint as a single YAML document and place the prompts inside a `prompts` array. Both structures are fully supported.

```yaml
# Single YAML document with a 'prompts' key
id: my-blueprint-v1
title: "My First Blueprint"
models:
  - openai:gpt-4o-mini
prompts:
  - id: p1
    prompt: "What is the capital of France?"
  - id: p2
    prompt: "What is 2 + 2?"
```

**How the Parser Interprets Structures**

The system automatically detects the structure of your YAML blueprint. This "smart parsing" makes it easy to write simple or complex blueprints without changing formats.

-   If the first YAML document in a file (i.e., everything before the first `---`) contains global configuration keys like `id`, `title`, or `models`, it is treated as the **Configuration Header**. All subsequent YAML documents in the file are then treated as a list of prompts.
-   If the first document does *not* appear to be a configuration header (e.g., it contains prompt-level keys like `prompt` or `should`), the parser assumes there is no global config. In this case, **all** documents in the file are treated as a stream of individual prompts.

#### Configuration Header Fields

The following fields can be included in the header section (Structure 1) or the main object (Structure 4).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | **(DEPRECATED & IGNORED)** This field is ignored. The blueprint's unique ID is now **always** derived from its file path. For example, a file at `blueprints/subdir/my-test.yml` will automatically have the ID `subdir__my-test`. Please remove this field from new blueprints. Aliased as `configId`. |
| `title` | `string` | **(Optional)** A human-readable title for the blueprint, displayed in the UI. If omitted, it defaults to the `id`. Aliased as `configTitle`. |
| `description` | `string` | **(Optional)** A longer description of the blueprint's purpose. Supports Markdown. |
| `author` | `string \| object` | **(Optional)** Attribution for the blueprint author. Can be a simple string name or an object with `name`, `url`, and `image_url` fields. |
| `references` / `citations` | `string \| object \| array` | **(Optional)** One or more citations or references this blueprint is based on. Can be a single string/object, or an array of strings/objects. Each object should have a `title` (alias: `name`) and an optional `url`. All aliases are accepted: `reference`, `citation`, `references`, `citations`. |
| `tags` | `string[]` | **(Optional)** An array of tags for categorizing and filtering blueprints on the homepage. |
| `models` | `string[] \| object[]` | **(Optional)** An array of model identifiers to run the evaluation against. Can include standard model strings in the format `provider:model` (e.g., `openai:gpt-4o-mini`) and/or custom model definition objects for arbitrary HTTP endpoints. If omitted, defaults to `["CORE"]`. See detailed model configuration below. |
| `system` | `string` | **(Optional)** A global system prompt to be used for all prompts in the blueprint, unless overridden at the prompt level. Aliased as `systemPrompt`. |
| `temperature` | `number` | **(Optional)** A single temperature setting to run for each model. This is overridden if the `temperatures` array is present. |
| `temperatures`| `number[]` | **(Optional)** An array of temperature settings to run for each model. This will create separate evaluations for each temperature. **Note:** Using this feature will append a suffix like `[temp:0.5]` to the model ID in the final output file, creating a unique identifier for each run variant. |
| `evaluationConfig` | `object` | **(Optional)** Advanced configuration for evaluation methods. See detailed options below. |
| `point_defs` | `object` | **(Optional)** Map of reusable point-function snippets. Keys are definition names; values are either JavaScript strings (expanded as `$js`) or full point objects. Reuse them inside prompts with `$ref`. |
| `tools` | `object[]` | **(Optional)** Trace-only tool inventory for tool-use evaluation. Each tool has `{ name: string, description?: string, schema?: object }` (JSON Schema for arguments, recommended). |
| `toolUse` | `object` | **(Optional)** Tool-use policy (trace-only). Supported keys: `{ enabled?: boolean, mode?: 'trace-only', maxSteps?: number, outputFormat?: 'json-line' }`. Default mode is trace-only; no execution is performed. |
| `context` | `object` | **(Optional)** Frozen, deterministic data available to prompts (e.g., a small corpus). Shape is user-defined. |
| `render_as` | `string` | **(Optional)** Sets the default rendering mode for all prompts in the blueprint. Can be `markdown`, `html`, or `plaintext`. Defaults to `markdown`. Overridden by prompt-level `render_as`. |
| `noCache` | `boolean` | **(Optional)** If `true`, sets the default caching behavior for all prompts to `noCache`. This can be overridden by a per-prompt `noCache` setting. This only affects the initial model response generation, not subsequent evaluation steps like `llm-coverage`, which have their own caching. |

#### Evaluation Configuration (`evaluationConfig`)

The `evaluationConfig` field allows you to customize how evaluations are performed. Currently, only `llm-coverage` evaluation can be configured.

**Structure:**

```yaml
evaluationConfig:
  llm-coverage:
    judges: [...]           # Custom judge configuration
    useExperimentalScale: true  # Use 9-point scale instead of 5-point
```

##### LLM Coverage Evaluation Options

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `judges` | `Judge[]` | **(Optional)** Custom judge configuration. If omitted, uses the default judges. Each judge is an object with `id`, `model`, and `approach` fields. See below for details. |
| `useExperimentalScale` | `boolean` | **(Optional)** If `true`, uses the experimental 9-point classification scale (0.0, 0.001, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875, 1.0) instead of the default 5-point scale (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0). This provides finer granularity in rubric scoring. |
| `judgeModels` | `string[]` | **(Deprecated)** Legacy field for backwards compatibility. Use `judges` instead. |
| `judgeMode` | `'failover' \| 'consensus'` | **(Deprecated)** Legacy field for backwards compatibility. The system now always uses consensus mode across all configured judges. |

##### Judge Configuration

Each judge in the `judges` array is an object with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | ❌ | Optional identifier for the judge (e.g., `'holistic-gpt4'`). Used for logging and result tracking. |
| `model` | `string` | ✅ | Model identifier in `provider:model` format (e.g., `'openai:gpt-4o-mini'`, `'anthropic:claude-3.5-haiku'`). |
| `approach` | `'standard' \| 'prompt-aware' \| 'holistic'` | ✅ | Evaluation approach. Currently, all approaches use the same prompt format that includes full conversation context. |

**Default Judges:**

If no custom judges are specified, the system uses these default judges:
```yaml
judges:
  - id: 'holistic-qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507'
    model: 'openrouter:qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507'
    approach: 'holistic'
  - id: 'holistic-openai-gpt-oss-120b'
    model: 'openrouter:openai/gpt-oss-120b'
    approach: 'holistic'
```

**Example with Custom Judges:**

```yaml
title: "Custom Judge Configuration Example"
models:
  - openai:gpt-4o-mini
evaluationConfig:
  llm-coverage:
    judges:
      - id: 'primary-judge'
        model: 'anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet'
        approach: 'holistic'
      - id: 'secondary-judge'
        model: 'openai:gpt-4o'
        approach: 'prompt-aware'
    useExperimentalScale: true
---
- id: p1
  prompt: "Explain the benefits of electric vehicles."
  should:
    - "Mentions environmental benefits"
    - "Discusses cost savings"
```

**Backup Judge:**

If all configured judges fail to return a valid assessment, the system automatically attempts to use a backup judge (`anthropic:claude-3.5-haiku` with `holistic` approach) to ensure evaluation can complete. This backup is only used when custom judges are not configured.

#### Model Configuration

The `models` field supports both standard model identifiers and custom model definitions for maximum flexibility.

##### Standard Model Identifiers

Standard model identifiers are strings in the format `provider:model` with no spaces:

```yaml
models:
  - openai:gpt-4o-mini
  - anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307
  - google:gemini-1.5-flash-latest
  - mistral:mistral-large-latest
  - together:meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo
  - xai:grok-beta
  - openrouter:google/gemini-pro
```

The system will attempt to gracefully correct common formatting errors, but adhering to the standard format is recommended.

##### Custom Model Definitions

For local models, custom endpoints, or proxies, you can define arbitrary HTTP-compatible models using object syntax:

```yaml
models:
  - openai:gpt-4o-mini  # Standard model
  
  # Local LLaMA model via Ollama with parameter control
  - id: 'local:llama3-8b'
    url: 'http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions'
    modelName: 'llama3:instruct'
    inherit: 'openai'
    headers:
      Authorization: 'Bearer whatever-i-want'
    parameters:
      max_tokens: 150      # Override system default
      stream: null         # Remove stream parameter entirely
      
  # Local completions-format model
  - id: 'local:llama-completions'
    url: 'http://localhost:4891/v1/completions'
    modelName: 'llama-3-8b-instruct'
    inherit: 'openai'
    format: 'completions'
    parameters:
      max_tokens: 100
      stream: null
      temperature: 0.7
  
  # Custom Anthropic-compatible proxy
  - id: 'proxy:claude-sonnet'
    url: 'https://my-proxy.com/v1/messages'
    modelName: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229'
    inherit: 'anthropic'
    headers:
      X-API-Key: '${PROXY_API_KEY}'
      X-Custom-Header: 'value'
```

###### Custom Model Object Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | ✅ | Unique identifier for this custom model (e.g., `'local:llama3-8b'`) |
| `url` | `string` | ✅ | Full HTTP endpoint URL for the model API |
| `modelName` | `string` | ✅ | Model name to send in API requests |
| `inherit` | `string` | ✅ | API format to inherit: `'openai'`, `'anthropic'`, `'google'`, `'mistral'`, `'together'`, `'xai'`, or `'openrouter'` |
| `format` | `string` | ❌ | API endpoint format: `'chat'` (default) or `'completions'` |
| `promptFormat` | `string` | ❌ | For completions format: `'conversational'` (adds "User: ... Assistant:") or `'raw'` (uses prompt text directly) |
| `headers` | `object` | ❌ | Additional HTTP headers to include in requests |
| `parameters` | `object` | ❌ | Parameter overrides. Set values or use `null` to exclude parameters entirely |
| `parameterMapping` | `object` | ❌ | Map standard parameter names to provider-specific names |

###### Inheritance Patterns

The `inherit` field determines the request/response format:

- **`'openai'`** - OpenAI ChatCompletions format (messages array, system prompt, temperature, etc.)
- **`'anthropic'`** - Anthropic Messages format (separate system field, filtered messages)
- **`'google'`** - Google Gemini format (contents array, generationConfig, systemInstruction)
- **`'mistral'`** - Mistral format (similar to OpenAI)
- **`'together'`**, **`'xai'`**, **`'openrouter'`** - OpenAI-compatible formats

###### Parameter Control

The `parameters` field provides fine-grained control over API request parameters. You can override system defaults, add custom parameters, or exclude parameters entirely.

```yaml
models:
  # Clean parameter overrides (recommended approach)
  - id: 'local:controlled-model'
    url: 'http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions'
    modelName: 'custom-model'
    inherit: 'openai'
    parameters:
      max_tokens: 100         # Override system default (usually 1500)
      temperature: 0.9        # Override system default
      stream: null            # Remove stream parameter entirely
      stop: ['END', 'STOP']   # Add custom stop sequences
      custom_param: 'value'   # Add provider-specific parameter
      
  # Using null to exclude unwanted parameters
  - id: 'local:minimal-model'
    url: 'http://localhost:8080/v1/completions'
    modelName: 'minimal-model'
    inherit: 'openai'
    format: 'completions'
    parameters:
      max_tokens: 50
      stream: null            # Exclude stream
      top_p: null            # Exclude top_p
      frequency_penalty: null # Exclude frequency_penalty
```

**Parameter Behavior:**
- **Set values**: Any non-null value overrides the system default
- **`null` values**: Completely remove the parameter from the request
- **Falsy values**: `0`, `false`, `""`, and `undefined` are preserved as valid parameter values
- **Final precedence**: `parameters` field has the highest precedence and will override all system-generated values

###### Parameter Mapping

You can also remap standard parameter names to provider-specific names using `parameterMapping`:

```yaml
models:
  - id: 'custom:mapped-params'
    url: 'https://special-api.com/generate'
    modelName: 'special-model'
    inherit: 'openai'
    parameterMapping:
      temperature: 'heat'          # temperature → heat
      maxTokens: 'token_limit'     # maxTokens → token_limit
      topP: 'nucleus_sampling'     # topP → nucleus_sampling
    parameters:
      heat: 0.9                   # Uses mapped name
      token_limit: 200            # Uses mapped name
      custom_param: 'value'       # Direct parameter
```

###### Reasoning Model Support

Custom models support advanced reasoning parameters:

```yaml
models:
  # OpenAI-style reasoning model
  - id: 'local:reasoning-model'
    url: 'http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions'
    modelName: 'o1-local'
    inherit: 'openai'
    # Will handle reasoningEffort parameter as 'reasoning_effort'
    
  # Anthropic-style thinking model
  - id: 'custom:thinking-claude'
    url: 'https://thinking-api.com/v1/messages'
    modelName: 'thinking-claude-3'
    inherit: 'anthropic'
    # Will handle thinkingBudget parameter as 'thinking' object
```

###### Environment Variable Substitution

You can use environment variables in headers and other string fields:

```yaml
models:
  - id: 'private:enterprise-model'
    url: 'https://enterprise-api.com/v1/chat'
    modelName: 'enterprise-gpt'
    inherit: 'openai'
    headers:
      Authorization: 'Bearer ${ENTERPRISE_API_KEY}'
      X-Org-ID: '${ENTERPRISE_ORG_ID}'
```

**Note**: Environment variable substitution is not performed by the blueprint parser itself, but by the runtime environment where the evaluation is executed.

#### Prompt Fields

Each item in the list of prompts is an object that can contain the following fields.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | **(Optional)** A unique identifier for the prompt within the blueprint. Useful for tracking a specific prompt's performance over time. **If omitted, a stable ID will be automatically generated by hashing the prompt's content.** |
| `prompt` | `string` | The text of the prompt to be sent to the model for a single-turn conversation. **Required if `messages` is not present.** An alias for the more formal `promptText`. |
| `messages` | `object[]` | An array of message objects for multi-turn conversations. **Required if `prompt` is not present.** Cannot be used with `prompt`. See message formats below. |
| `ideal` | `string` | **(Optional)** A "gold-standard" answer against which model responses can be compared for semantic similarity. An alias for `idealResponse`. |
| `system` | `string` | **(Optional)** A system prompt that overrides the global `system` prompt for this specific prompt only. |
| `citation` / `reference` | `string \| object` | **(Optional)** A citation or reference for the prompt, such as a URL, paper reference, or source documentation. Can be a simple string or an object with `title` (alias: `name`) and `url` fields. Both `citation` and `reference` are accepted as aliases. |
| `should` | `(string \| object)[] \| (string \| object)[][]` | **(Optional)** A list of rubric points for the `llm-coverage` evaluation method. Defines the criteria for a successful response. To define alternative valid paths ("OR" logic), this can be a list of lists. Aliased as `points`, `expect`, `expects`, or `expectations`. See details below. |
| `should_not` | `(string \| object)[] \| (string \| object)[][]` | **(Optional)** A list of rubric points defining criteria that a response **should not** meet. It follows the exact same syntax as the `should` block, including support for a list of lists to create alternative "should not" paths. |
| `weight` | `number` | **(Optional)** Prompt-level importance multiplier used when averaging scores across prompts. Defaults to `1.0`. Valid range: `0.1`–`10`. Aliases: `importance`, `multiplier`. |
| `requiredTools` | `string[]` | **(Optional)** For tool-use scenarios, list of tools that must be called in the emitted trace. |
| `prohibitedTools` | `string[]` | **(Optional)** For tool-use scenarios, tools that must not be called. |
| `maxCalls` | `number` | **(Optional)** Per-prompt cap for tool calls expected in the emitted trace. |
| `render_as` | `string` | **(Optional)** Sets the rendering mode for this specific prompt's output, overriding the global setting. Can be `markdown`, `html`, or `plaintext`. |
| `noCache` | `boolean` | **(Optional)** If `true`, forces a fresh generation for this prompt, overriding the global `--cache` flag. Defaults to `false`. |

##### Message Formats (`messages` array)

You can define conversation messages in two ways:

**1. Formal Syntax (Recommended for clarity)**

```yaml
messages:
  - role: 'user'
    content: 'Tell me about the Roman Empire.'
  - role: 'assistant'
    content: 'The Roman Empire was one of the most powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in the world.'
  - role: 'user'
    content: 'What was its capital?'
```

**2. Shorthand Syntax (Convenient for quick authoring)**

You can also use a more compact format where the role is the key. `ai` is also supported as an alias for `assistant`.

```yaml
messages:
  - user: 'Tell me about the Roman Empire.'
  - assistant: 'The Roman Empire was one of the most powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in the world.'
  # You can also leave an assistant turn as null to generate it during the run:
  - assistant: null
  - user: 'And then what happened?'
```

##### Sequential multi-turn with assistant: null (generated turns)

You can model realistic, multi-turn conversations and have the candidate model generate one or more assistant turns during execution by placing `assistant: null` in the `messages` array. The pipeline will:

- Generate a response at each `assistant: null`, append it to the working history, and continue.
- If the final message is a user message, implicitly generate a final assistant turn (as if there were a trailing `assistant: null`).
- Use the concatenation of all generated assistant turns as the subject text for evaluation (function checks and LLM-judged points).
- Save the full conversation history (original messages plus generated turns) for each prompt×model.

Example:

```yaml
- id: clarify-taxes
  description: The assistant should ask clarifying questions before offering guidance. We evaluate over the aggregated generated content across turns.
  messages:
    - user: I need help with my taxes.
    - assistant: null          # model generates turn 1
    - user: I changed jobs mid-year and moved states.
    - assistant: null          # model generates turn 2
    - user: Anything else I should consider?  # implicit final assistant generation
  should:
    - Asks at least one clarifying question before giving suggestions.
    - $word_count_between: [30, 500]
  should_not:
    - $matches: "(?i)not a (financial|tax) advisor" # example negative check
```

Notes and guarantees:

- Validation allows `assistant: null`. All other roles must have non-empty string content.
- If the last authored assistant message is a string (non-null), that message may be used as the final output if no generation is needed at the end.
- Judges always receive the full transcript with clear markers; UI shows authored nulls as “assistant: null — to be generated” and displays the generated thread where available.

### The `should` and `should_not` Rubrics

These blocks define the criteria for rubric-based evaluation. The `should` block defines positive criteria (what a good response includes), while the `should_not` block defines negative criteria (what a good response avoids). The `should_not` block follows the exact same syntax, but it inverts the result of each check.

> ⚠️ **Deprecation Notice**: The `should_not` block is considered legacy and will be deprecated in a future version. We recommend using **negative point-functions** (e.g., `$not_contains`, `$not_matches`) directly in `should` blocks instead. This approach is more readable, avoids double-negative confusion, and works better with complex rubric logic. See the [migration guide](#migrating-from-should_not-to-negative-functions) below.

Each item in these arrays is a point definition, processed in the following order of precedence:

#### Defining Alternative Rubric Paths (OR logic)

By default, all criteria within a `should` or `should_not` block are treated as an "AND" condition—a response must satisfy all of them to be considered fully successful.

To express an "OR" condition, where a response is considered valid if it satisfies one of several distinct sets of criteria, you can use a **nested list**. Each inner list is a complete, alternative rubric path.

```yaml
should:
  # Path 1: A response is valid if it meets BOTH of these criteria...
  - - "is kind and polite."
    - $contains: "Here is a recipe"

  # OR Path 2: ...or if it meets BOTH of these other criteria.
  - - "is inquisitive and asks a clarifying question."
    - "offers to find a recipe based on user's preferences."

  # OR Path 3: ...or if it just does this one thing.
  - - "politely declines because it cannot guarantee recipe quality."
```

**Scoring Behavior**: When alternative paths are used, the system calculates the average score for *each* path independently. The final score for the entire block is then the **highest** of these path scores.

**Mixing Required and Alternative Paths**

You can also mix required points with a block of alternative paths. This powerful combination allows you to define core criteria that *must* be met, alongside several optional ways to satisfy other parts of the rubric.

When mixing, the score for the alternative path block (the highest-scoring path) is treated as a single point and is averaged with all the other required points.

```yaml
should:
  # This point is ALWAYS required
  - "The response must be in English."

  # This is a block of alternative paths. The score for this block
  # will be the score of the best-performing path inside it.
  - - # Path 1: Direct Answer
      - "Provides the correct answer."
      - $contains: "42"
    - # Path 2: Asks for Clarification
      - "Asks what 'the meaning of life' refers to."

  # This function check is also ALWAYS required
  - $word_count_between: [10, 200]
```

In the example above, the final score will be the average of:
1.  The score for "The response must be in English."
2.  The score for the *best* of (Path 1, Path 2).
3.  The score for the `$word_count_between` check.

**Alternative Paths in `should_not`**

The same logic applies to the `should_not` block. This is useful for defining multiple, distinct failure modes. A response fails if it satisfies *any* of the alternative "should not" paths.

```yaml
should_not:
  # Fail if the response is BOTH rude AND dismissive
  - - "is rude"
    - "is dismissive"

  # OR fail if the response contains specific forbidden phrases
  - - $contains_any_of: ["I am not a lawyer", "This is not legal advice"]
```

If no nesting is used, the block is parsed as a single path, preserving full backward compatibility with older blueprints.

#### ⚠️ Common Pitfall: Single-Element Nested Arrays

**Before you use nested arrays, make sure you actually need OR logic!**

Single-element nested arrays are a common mistake that can dramatically lower your scores. If each nested array contains only one criterion, you probably don't need nesting at all.

**❌ DON'T DO THIS** (creates unnecessary OR logic between individual points):
```yaml
should:
  - - $imatches: 'Lagos.{0,50}Nigeria'
  - - $imatches: 'Kinshasa.{0,50}(?:Congo|DRC)'
```

This creates two separate single-element alternative paths. The system will:
1. Score the first path: 0.0
2. Score the second path: 0.0
3. Take the maximum: max(0.0, 0.0) = 0.0
4. Average with other points, **drastically lowering your overall score**

**✅ DO THIS INSTEAD** (both points are required with standard AND logic):
```yaml
should:
  - $imatches: 'Lagos.{0,50}Nigeria'
  - $imatches: 'Kinshasa.{0,50}(?:Congo|DRC)'
```

This treats both as required points that are simply averaged together.

**When nested arrays ARE appropriate:**

Nested arrays should only be used when you have **multiple criteria that must be met together** as an alternative to other sets of criteria:

```yaml
should:
  # Path 1: Both of these criteria together
  - - "Response is polite and empathetic"
    - $contains: "I understand your concern"

  # Path 2: Both of these criteria together as an alternative
  - - "Response asks clarifying questions"
    - $word_count_between: [20, 100]
```

**Rule of thumb:** If you're creating nested arrays with only one item each, you almost certainly want a flat list instead.

#### Understanding the Aggregation Formula

Understanding how scores are calculated when mixing required points with alternative paths is crucial for predicting your blueprint's behavior.

**The Algorithm:**

1. **Group all points** by their `pathId`:
   - Points without a `pathId` (or empty `pathId`) → Required points group
   - Points with `pathId: "path_8"` → Path 8 group
   - Points with `pathId: "path_9"` → Path 9 group

2. **Calculate weighted average for each group:**
   - Each point's score is multiplied by its `multiplier` (default: 1)
   - Sum all weighted scores in the group
   - Divide by sum of all multipliers in the group

3. **For alternative paths, take the maximum:**
   - Find the highest-scoring path from all alternative path groups
   - This becomes the "best alternative path score"

4. **Combine required and alternative scores:**
   - If you have only required points: return their weighted average
   - If you have only alternative paths: return the best path score
   - If you have both: average the required score with the best path score

**Worked Example:**

```yaml
should:
  - "Point A"           # Score: 1.0, no pathId → required
  - "Point B"           # Score: 0.75, no pathId → required
  - "Point C"           # Score: 0.5, no pathId → required
  - - "Path 1A"         # Score: 0.2, pathId: "path_3"
    - "Path 1B"         # Score: 0.0, pathId: "path_3"
  - - "Path 2A"         # Score: 0.0, pathId: "path_4"
    - "Path 2B"         # Score: 0.0, pathId: "path_4"
```

**Step-by-step calculation:**

1. **Required points** (no pathId):
   - Points: A (1.0), B (0.75), C (0.5)
   - Average: (1.0 + 0.75 + 0.5) / 3 = **0.75 (75%)**

2. **Path 1** (path_3):
   - Points: 1A (0.2), 1B (0.0)
   - Average: (0.2 + 0.0) / 2 = **0.10 (10%)**

3. **Path 2** (path_4):
   - Points: 2A (0.0), 2B (0.0)
   - Average: (0.0 + 0.0) / 2 = **0.00 (0%)**

4. **Best alternative path:**
   - max(0.10, 0.00) = **0.10 (10%)**

5. **Final score:**
   - Average of required (0.75) and best path (0.10)
   - (0.75 + 0.10) / 2 = **0.425 (42.5%)**

**Key insight:** Even though 3 out of 5 required points scored well (75% average), the low-scoring alternative paths dragged the final score down to 42.5%. This is why single-element paths with low scores can have such a dramatic impact.

**With multipliers:**

```yaml
should:
  - point: "Critical requirement"
    weight: 3.0          # Score: 1.0, multiplier: 3
  - "Standard point"     # Score: 0.5, multiplier: 1 (default)
```

Weighted average: (1.0 × 3 + 0.5 × 1) / (3 + 1) = 3.5 / 4 = **0.875 (87.5%)**

#### When to Use Alternative Paths

Alternative paths (OR logic) are powerful but should be used sparingly and intentionally. Here's guidance on appropriate use cases.

**✅ Good Use Cases:**

1. **Measurement Controversies or Disputed Facts**
   ```yaml
   should:
     # Nile vs Amazon as longest river depends on measurement methodology
     - - $imatches: 'Nile[\s\S]+Amazon'
     - - $imatches: 'Amazon[\s\S]+Nile'
   ```

2. **Naming Variations for the Same Entity**
   ```yaml
   should:
     # Accept either official name or common name
     - - $imatches: 'Myanmar'
     - - $imatches: 'Myanmar.{0,100}Burma|Burma.{0,100}Myanmar'
   ```

3. **Multiple Valid Solution Approaches**
   ```yaml
   should:
     # Either approach is acceptable
     - - "Provides a direct answer"
       - $contains: "The answer is"
     - - "Asks clarifying questions"
       - "Requests more context before answering"
   ```

4. **Regional or Temporal Variations**
   ```yaml
   should:
     # Different facts true in different time periods
     - - $imatches: 'Constantinople.{0,50}capital'  # Historical
     - - $imatches: 'Istanbul.{0,50}capital'        # Modern
   ```

5. **Multiple Correct Formats**
   ```yaml
   should:
     # Accept various date formats
     - - $matches: '\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}'  # ISO format
     - - $matches: '\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}'  # US format
     - - $matches: '\d{2}\.\d{2}\.\d{4}'  # European format
   ```

**❌ Poor Use Cases (Use Flat Lists Instead):**

1. **When You Actually Want All Items Checked**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ WRONG: Creates OR logic, only best path counts
   should:
     - - $contains: "Lagos"
     - - $contains: "Cairo"
     - - $contains: "Nairobi"

   # ✅ CORRECT: All three are required
   should:
     - $contains: "Lagos"
     - $contains: "Cairo"
     - $contains: "Nairobi"
   ```

2. **When Alternatives Aren't Truly Equivalent**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ WRONG: These have very different quality standards
   should:
     - - "Provides comprehensive, well-researched answer"
       - $word_count_between: [200, 500]
     - - "Mentions the topic briefly"
   ```

3. **When You Have Single-Element Paths**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ WRONG: Unnecessary nesting
   should:
     - - "First criterion"
     - - "Second criterion"

   # ✅ CORRECT: Simple flat list
   should:
     - "First criterion"
     - "Second criterion"
   ```

**Decision Tree:**

```
Do you have multiple criteria that could satisfy the requirement?
├─ NO → Use a flat list (standard AND logic)
│
└─ YES → Do each alternative have multiple related criteria?
    ├─ NO → You probably want a flat list with $..._any_of functions
    │       Example: $contains_any_of: ["option1", "option2", "option3"]
    │
    └─ YES → Are the alternatives truly equivalent in quality/completeness?
        ├─ NO → Reconsider your rubric structure
        │
        └─ YES → Use nested arrays (OR logic) ✓
```

#### Troubleshooting: "Why Is My Score Lower Than Expected?"

If your blueprint is producing unexpectedly low scores, here are common causes and fixes:

**1. Accidental Single-Element Nested Arrays**

**Symptom:** Score is roughly half of what you expected.

**Check for:**
```yaml
should:
  - - $imatches: 'point1'  # ⚠️ Single-element path
  - - $imatches: 'point2'  # ⚠️ Single-element path
```

**Fix:** Remove extra nesting level:
```yaml
should:
  - $imatches: 'point1'
  - $imatches: 'point2'
```

**2. Low-Scoring Alternative Paths**

**Symptom:** All required points pass (high scores), but overall score is much lower.

**Diagnosis:** Calculate manually:
- Required points average: 80%
- Alternative paths: max(0%, 0%) = 0%
- Final: (80% + 0%) / 2 = 40%

**Fix:** Either:
- Remove the alternative paths if they're not needed
- Rewrite alternatives to be more lenient
- Use `$contains_any_of` instead of multiple paths

**3. Graded Functions Returning Partial Credit**

**Symptom:** Scores like 0.33, 0.67, 0.75 when you expected 1.0.

**Cause:** Functions like `$contains_all_of` give partial credit:
```yaml
- $contains_all_of: ["term1", "term2", "term3"]
# If only 2 of 3 found: 0.67 score
```

**Fix:** If you need all-or-nothing:
- Use `$contains_any_of` for "at least one"
- Use multiple separate `$contains` checks for "must have all"
- Use `$js` for custom logic

**4. Inverted Points in Wrong Block**

**Symptom:** Unexpected low scores on seemingly simple checks.

**Cause:** Using `should` for negative criteria:
```yaml
should:
  - "Response does not contain errors"  # ⚠️ Ambiguous
```

**Fix:** Use negative functions in `should` (recommended):
```yaml
should:
  - $not_contains: "ERROR"
  - $not_contains: "undefined"
```

Or use `should_not` block (legacy approach):
```yaml
should_not:
  - $contains: "ERROR"
  - $contains: "undefined"
```

**5. Regex Pattern Too Strict**

**Symptom:** Deterministic function checks always return 0.

**Diagnosis:** Test your regex pattern separately. Common issues:
- Forgot to escape special characters: `$matches: "2+2"` (should be `"2\\+2"`)
- Overly specific whitespace: `$matches: "A  B"` (won't match "A B" with one space)
- Case sensitivity: `$matches: "tokyo"` (won't match "Tokyo")

**Fix:**
- Use `$imatches` for case-insensitive matching
- Use `\s+` for flexible whitespace
- Use `[\s\S]+` or `.{0,50}` for flexible content between terms
- Test with online regex tools (regex101.com)

**Quick Diagnostic Commands:**

If you have access to the evaluation output JSON, check:

```javascript
// Find the specific prompt result
const result = evaluationResults.llmCoverageScores["your-prompt-id"]["model-id"];

// Check individual point scores
result.pointAssessments.forEach(p => {
  console.log(p.keyPointText, p.coverageExtent, p.pathId);
});

// Expected score calculation
const requiredPoints = result.pointAssessments.filter(p => !p.pathId);
const pathGroups = {};
result.pointAssessments.filter(p => p.pathId).forEach(p => {
  if (!pathGroups[p.pathId]) pathGroups[p.pathId] = [];
  pathGroups[p.pathId].push(p);
});
```

#### Point Definition Formats

1.  **Plain Language Rubric (LLM-Judged Check)**: This is the simplest and most powerful way to create a rubric. Each string is a criterion that an AI "judge" will evaluate for its conceptual presence in the model's response.
    ```yaml
    should:
      - "be empathetic and understanding."
      - "acknowledge the user's difficulty."
    ```

2.  **Point with Citation (Recommended Shorthand)**: For the common case of adding a citation to a conceptual point, you can use a direct key-value pair. This supports multi-line strings for complex criteria using YAML block syntax.
    ```yaml
    should:
      - "Covers the principle of 'prudent man' rule.": "Investment Advisers Act of 1940"
      - ? |
          The response must detail the three core duties of a fiduciary:
          1. The Duty of Care
          2. The Duty of Loyalty
        : "SEC Rule on Fiduciary Duty"
    ```

3.  **Idiomatic Function (Deterministic Check)**: A quick way to perform exact, programmatic checks. **All idiomatic function calls must be prefixed with a `$`** to distinguish them from citable points.
    ```yaml
    should:
      # Object syntax (recommended)
      - $contains: "fiduciary duty"  # Case-sensitive check
      - $icontains: "fiduciary duty" # Case-insensitive

      # List-based checks
      - $contains_any_of: ["fiduciary", "duty"]  # True if any are found
      - $contains_all_of: ["fiduciary", "duty"]  # Graded score (0.5 if 1 of 2 is found)
      - $contains_at_least_n_of: [2, ["apples", "oranges", "pears"]]

      # Case-insensitive list-based checks
      - $icontains_any_of: ["Fiduciary", "DUTY"]  # Case-insensitive: true if any are found
      - $icontains_all_of: ["Fiduciary", "DUTY"]  # Case-insensitive: graded score
      - $icontains_at_least_n_of: [2, ["Apples", "ORANGES", "pears"]]

      # String position checks
      - $starts_with: "The ruling"   # Case-sensitive: must start with exact text
      - $istarts_with: "the ruling"  # Case-insensitive: can start with any case
      - $ends_with: "conclusion."    # Case-sensitive: must end with exact text
      - $iends_with: "CONCLUSION."   # Case-insensitive: can end with any case

      # Regex checks
      - $matches: "^The ruling states" # Case-sensitive regex
      - $imatches: "^the ruling"       # Case-insensitive regex
      - $matches_all_of: ["^The ruling", "states that$"] # Graded regex
      - $imatches_all_of: ["^the ruling", "states that$"] # Case-insensitive graded regex

      # Unicode-aware word boundary checks (recommended for accented text)
      - $contains_word: "Paraná"       # Matches "Paraná River" (handles accents!)
      - $icontains_word: "são paulo"   # Case-insensitive: matches "São Paulo"
      - $not_contains_word: "outdated" # Must NOT contain the word "outdated"
      - $not_icontains_word: "ERROR"   # Case-insensitive: must NOT contain "ERROR"

      # Negative functions (recommended over should_not blocks)
      - $not_contains: "I apologize"  # Must NOT contain this phrase
      - $not_icontains: "ERROR"  # Case-insensitive: must NOT contain
      - $not_contains_any_of: ["I feel", "I believe", "As an AI"]  # Must NOT contain any
      - $not_icontains_any_of: ["GUARANTEED", "Risk-Free"]  # Case-insensitive
      - $not_matches: "(?i)not a (financial|tax) advisor"  # Must NOT match pattern
      - $not_starts_with: "Unfortunately"  # Must NOT start with this
      - $not_ends_with: "..."  # Must NOT end with ellipsis

      # Other checks
      - $word_count_between: [50, 100]
      - $is_json: true
      - $js: "r.length > 100" # Advanced JS expression
      # $js can also return { score, explain } to customise the reflection text.
      - $ref: scoreBand          # Reuse a point defined in point_defs
    ```

    > 💡 **Recommended Pattern**: Use negative functions (`$not_*`) directly in `should` blocks rather than using `should_not` blocks. This makes blueprints more readable and avoids double-negative confusion. See the deprecation notice below for migration guidance.
4.  **Full Object (Maximum Control)**: For weighting points or adding citations. This is the most verbose, legacy-compatible format.
    ```yaml
    should:
      - point: "Covers the principle of 'prudent man' rule."
        weight: 3.0 # This point is 3x as important
      - fn: "contains"
        arg: "fiduciary duty"
        weight: 1.5
        citation: "Investment Advisers Act of 1940"
    ```
    *Note: `weight` is an alias for `multiplier`, `arg` for `fnArgs`.*

For more details, see the [POINTS_DOCUMENTATION.md](POINTS_DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Negative Point-Functions

Weval provides negative variants of most point-functions, prefixed with `$not_`. These functions return `true` when the criterion is **not** met, making them ideal for expressing negative constraints without the confusion of `should_not` blocks.

**Available Negative Functions:**

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `$not_contains` | Does NOT contain string (case-sensitive) | `$not_contains: "ERROR"` |
| `$not_icontains` | Does NOT contain string (case-insensitive) | `$not_icontains: "warning"` |
| `$not_contains_any_of` | Does NOT contain ANY of the strings | `$not_contains_any_of: ["spam", "scam"]` |
| `$not_icontains_any_of` | Case-insensitive variant | `$not_icontains_any_of: ["ERROR", "warning"]` |
| `$not_contains_all_of` | Graded: fewer matches = higher score | `$not_contains_all_of: ["bad", "worse", "worst"]` |
| `$not_icontains_all_of` | Case-insensitive graded variant | `$not_icontains_all_of: ["ERROR", "FAIL"]` |
| `$not_matches` | Does NOT match regex pattern | `$not_matches: "\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}"` |
| `$not_imatches` | Case-insensitive regex variant | `$not_imatches: "ssn.*\\d{4}"` |
| `$not_starts_with` | Does NOT start with prefix | `$not_starts_with: "I apologize"` |
| `$not_istarts_with` | Case-insensitive variant | `$not_istarts_with: "sorry"` |
| `$not_ends_with` | Does NOT end with suffix | `$not_ends_with: "..."` |
| `$not_iends_with` | Case-insensitive variant | `$not_iends_with: "tbc"` |
| `$contains_word` | Contains word with Unicode-aware boundaries | `$contains_word: "Paraná"` |
| `$icontains_word` | Case-insensitive Unicode-aware word match | `$icontains_word: "são"` |
| `$not_contains_word` | Does NOT contain word (Unicode-aware) | `$not_contains_word: "outdated"` |
| `$not_icontains_word` | Case-insensitive negative word match | `$not_icontains_word: "ERROR"` |

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Use `$contains_word` and `$icontains_word` when working with text containing accented characters (like Paraná, São Paulo, café) or non-Latin scripts (like 长江, Москва). JavaScript's standard `\b` word boundaries don't work with Unicode characters, but these functions use Unicode property escapes (`\p{L}`, `\p{N}`) to properly detect word boundaries across all scripts.

**Example:**
```yaml
should:
  # Positive criteria
  - "Provides accurate information"
  - $word_count_between: [50, 200]

  # Negative criteria using negative functions (recommended)
  - $not_contains_any_of: ["I'm not sure", "I don't know", "uncertain"]
  - $not_icontains: "ERROR"
  - $not_starts_with: "I apologize"
  - $not_matches: "\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}"  # No SSN patterns
```

### Migrating from `should_not` to Negative Functions

The `should_not` block can create confusion with double negatives and complex scoring logic. We recommend migrating to negative functions in `should` blocks.

**Before (using `should_not`):**
```yaml
prompt: "Explain investment strategies"
should:
  - "Discusses diversification"
  - "Mentions risk tolerance"
  - $word_count_between: [100, 300]

should_not:
  - $contains_any_of: ["guaranteed returns", "risk-free", "can't lose"]
  - $matches: "(?i)not a financial advisor"
  - "makes specific stock recommendations"
```

**After (using negative functions in `should`):**
```yaml
prompt: "Explain investment strategies"
should:
  # Positive criteria
  - "Discusses diversification"
  - "Mentions risk tolerance"
  - $word_count_between: [100, 300]

  # Negative criteria (clearer and more maintainable)
  - $not_contains_any_of: ["guaranteed returns", "risk-free", "can't lose"]
  - $not_imatches: "not a financial advisor"
  - "does NOT make specific stock recommendations"  # LLM-judged negation
```

**Benefits of Migration:**
1. **Eliminates double negatives**: `should_not` + "does not contain" = confusing
2. **Clearer rubric structure**: All criteria in one place
3. **Better with OR logic**: Avoids complex interactions between `should` and `should_not` alternative paths
4. **Easier to reason about scoring**: Single aggregation logic instead of two separate blocks

For more details, see the [POINTS_DOCUMENTATION.md](POINTS_DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Tool-Use (Trace-Only) Support

Weval supports evaluating tool-use without executing any tools. Models are instructed to emit a normalized, machine-parseable tool-call trace, which is parsed and scored deterministically.

#### How it works

- Declare tools and policy in the blueprint header using `tools` and `toolUse` (see table above). The default and only implemented mode is **trace-only**.
- In your prompt/system message, require the model to output each tool call as a single line prefixed by `TOOL_CALL`, followed by a JSON object with `name` and `arguments`:

```
TOOL_CALL {"name":"<tool>","arguments":{...}}
```

- Weval parses these lines from the assistant content and stores them in the result as `toolCalls` (no execution and no extra turns are performed).

#### Minimal example

```yaml
# Header
title: "Tool-Use: Calculator & Retrieval (trace-only)"
models:
  - openai:gpt-4o-mini
tools:
  - name: calculator
    description: "Evaluate arithmetic expressions."
    schema:
      type: object
      properties: { expression: { type: string } }
      required: [expression]
toolUse:
  enabled: true
  mode: trace-only
  maxSteps: 2
  outputFormat: json-line
---
# Prompts
- id: calc-1
  messages:
    - system: |
        Emit each tool call on its own line:
        TOOL_CALL {"name":"<tool>","arguments":{...}}
        Do not output any other text.
    - user: "What is (312*49) - 777?"
  should:
    - $tool_called: "calculator"
    - $tool_args_match: { name: "calculator", where: { expression: "(312*49)-777" } }
    - $tool_call_count_between: [1, 1, "calculator"]
```

#### Scoring tool-use

You can use these point functions in `should`/`should_not`:

##### `$tool_called(toolName: string)`

Returns `true` if the tool was called at least once, `false` otherwise.

```yaml
should:
  - $tool_called: "calculator"
  - $tool_called: "retrieve"
```

##### `$tool_args_match({ name: string, where: object|string, normalizeWhitespace?: boolean })`

Validates that a specific tool was called with arguments matching the criteria:

- **`name`** (required): Tool name to check
- **`where`** (required): Either:
  - An object for partial deep matching (checks if all specified keys/values exist in arguments)
  - A JavaScript expression string evaluated against `args` (e.g., `"args.expression.includes('*')"`)
- **`normalizeWhitespace`** (optional): If `true`, ignores whitespace differences in string comparisons

```yaml
should:
  # Partial object match
  - $tool_args_match:
      name: "retrieve"
      where:
        docId: "41"
        options:
          snippet: true

  # JavaScript expression
  - $tool_args_match:
      name: "calculator"
      where: "args.expression.includes('+')"

  # Normalize whitespace in argument strings
  - $tool_args_match:
      name: "search"
      where: {query: "climate change"}
      normalizeWhitespace: true
```

##### `$tool_call_count_between([min, max, name?])`

Validates the number of tool calls falls within a range. Returns `true` if count is within bounds, `false` otherwise.

- If `name` is provided (3rd argument), counts only that tool
- Otherwise counts all tools

```yaml
should:
  - $tool_call_count_between: [1, 3]              # 1-3 total calls
  - $tool_call_count_between: [1, 1, "calculator"] # Exactly 1 calculator call
  - $tool_call_count_between: [0, 2, "retrieve"]   # At most 2 retrieve calls
```

##### `$tool_call_order(["toolA", "toolB", ...])`

Validates that tools were called in the specified relative order (not necessarily contiguous). Returns `true` if the order is found, `false` otherwise.

```yaml
should:
  # These tools must appear in this order (other calls can appear between them)
  - $tool_call_order: ["search", "retrieve", "answer"]
```

**Note:** All tool-use checks are deterministic and operate on the parsed `toolCalls` trace only—no execution occurs.

##### Multi-step example

```yaml
title: "Research Assistant Tool Use"
models:
  - openai:gpt-4o-mini
tools:
  - name: search
    description: "Search the knowledge base"
    schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        query: {type: string}
      required: [query]
  - name: retrieve
    description: "Retrieve a full document"
    schema:

##### Important considerations

**Fairness:** When testing tool-use, clearly enumerate the available tools and their argument schemas in the system prompt. Requiring specific tool names or argument structures without documenting them in the prompt makes the evaluation unfair, as models cannot infer arbitrary conventions.

**Experimental status:** The emission format (`TOOL_CALL {"name":"...","arguments":{...}}`) and point function semantics may change in future versions. This format was chosen for simplicity but is not based on any standard protocol.

### Legacy JSON Blueprint Format

While YAML is recommended, JSON is fully supported. JSON blueprints must be a single object with a top-level `prompts` array. All fields and aliases documented above apply equally to JSON.

#### Minimal JSON

```json
{
  "title": "My First Blueprint",
  "models": ["openai:gpt-4o-mini"],
  "prompts": [
    { "id": "p1", "promptText": "What is the capital of France?" },
    { "id": "p2", "promptText": "What is 2 + 2?" }
  ]
}
```

#### Rich JSON example (aliases, points, and messages)

```json
{
  "title": "Normalization Test",
  "systemPrompt": "Global system prompt",
  "point_defs": { "scoreBand": "return 1;" },
  "prompts": [
    {
      "id": "p1",
      "messages": [
        { "role": "user", "content": "Hello" },
        { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there" }
      ],
      "idealResponse": "Ideal response",
      "points": [
        "A simple conceptual point.",
        { "Covers the 'prudent man' rule.": "Investment Advisers Act of 1940" },
        { "$contains": "fiduciary" },
        { "fn": "ends_with", "fnArgs": "." }
      ],
      "should_not": [ { "$contains": "guarantee" } ],
      "noCache": false
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Notes

- JSON must be a single object with a top-level `prompts` array. Streams/lists of documents are YAML-only conveniences.
- Aliases supported: `promptText` → `prompt`, `idealResponse` → `ideal`, `reference`/`citation` (string or object). Point-object aliases: `weight` ↔ `multiplier`, `arg` ↔ `fnArgs`.
- `messages` accepts the same formats as YAML; `assistant: null` is allowed to request generated turns; `ai` is an alias for `assistant`.
- `render_as` and `noCache` are supported globally and per-prompt with the same semantics as YAML.
- Reusable definitions via `point_defs` work the same; reference them inside points with `$ref`.

## Contribution

To contribute a blueprint, please follow the guidance in the [main Weval application repository](https://github.com/weval-org/app). You can submit a 'pull request' to add your blueprint file to the `/blueprints` directory.

### Creating Your First Blueprint: A Simple Guide for Everyone

New to Weval or coding? No problem! You can contribute a valuable evaluation blueprint in just a few minutes. Here's a simple, step-by-step guide to get you started.

**The Goal:** We'll create a simple blueprint that asks a model a few questions and checks if the answers contain key concepts.

**1. Start with a Simple Template**

This is the easiest structure for a blueprint. It's just a list of questions. You don't need to worry about a configuration header.

```yaml
# A simple list of prompts. Give your file a descriptive name like 'my-first-blueprint.yml'
# The system will automatically use the filename as the title.

- prompt: |
    What are the most important responsibilities of a journalist?
  should:
    - "Should mention objectivity or impartiality."
    - "Should mention verifying sources or fact-checking."
    - "Should mention a duty to inform the public."

- prompt: |
    A politician is accused of corruption, but there is no definitive proof yet.
    How should a news outlet report on this story?
  should:
    - "Report on the allegations without presenting them as fact."
    - "Use neutral language (e.g., 'accused of', 'alleged')."
    - "Include the politician's response or denial, if available."
    - "Avoid sensationalism."
```

**2. How to Create Your Blueprint File**

You don't need any special software. You can create your blueprint file directly on GitHub.

1.  **Think of a topic** that aligns with our civic-minded mission (like human rights, public safety, or democratic values).
2.  **Write your prompts** and the simple "should" criteria like in the template above. What are the key ideas a good answer *must* include?
3.  **Follow our guide** on [**Adding a New Blueprint via GitHub's Web Interface**](#option-1-adding-a-new-blueprint-via-githubs-web-interface-easiest-for-single-files). This guide will walk you through the few clicks it takes to add your file and propose it for inclusion.

That's it! By creating even a simple blueprint, you're helping us all better understand how AI models handle important societal topics.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── blueprints/                # Main directory for evaluation blueprint files
│   ├── udhr-article19-eval.yml
│   └── another-civic-topic-eval.yaml
├── models/                 # Directory for reusable Model Collection JSON files

```

*   **`/blueprints/`**: This is where your evaluation blueprint files live. Each file defines a specific evaluation suite. We recommend the new YAML format (`.yml` or `.yaml`).
*   **`/models/`**: This directory contains JSON files defining reusable "Model Collections" (e.g., a standard set of core models to test against).

## What Makes a Good Weval Blueprint?

A high-signal blueprint is a precise diagnostic instrument, not a simple trivia quiz. To construct one, we encourage contributors to follow these core principles, which are specifically tailored to the unique nature of modern LLMs:

*   **Test Reasoning, Not Recall.** LLMs have memorized vast amounts of text. A valuable test is one that requires judgment in ambiguous or novel scenarios, revealing how the model synthesizes information, not just if it can retrieve a fact.

*   **Prioritize Qualitative Rubrics.** Chat models are masters of paraphrase and can easily bypass simple keyword checks (`$contains`). It is far more robust to test the *concept* of a correct response. Define abstract success criteria in the `should` and `should_not` blocks (e.g., `"The response acknowledges the user's distress without offering medical advice"`).

*   **Isolate Variables.** To create a rigorous test, treat it like a scientific experiment. If you are testing for a specific bias, create multiple probes that change only one key detail at a time (e.g., a name, a location, the order of presentation). This allows you to be confident that you are measuring what you intend to.

*   **Think Adversarially.** The most insightful tests often try to find the model's breaking points. Craft prompts that might lure a poorly-aligned model into a known failure mode. Use loaded questions, subtle framing, or false premises to see if the model takes the bait or if its safety training holds up.

#### The Most Important Principle: Ground Your Rubric in Evidence

A blueprint's power and credibility come from its objectivity. The goal is not to test if a model agrees with a personal opinion, but to measure its adherence to an established, authoritative standard.

**A high-quality blueprint is evidence-grounded.** Before writing, identify a canonical source for your topic (e.g., a legal statute, a human rights charter, an industry best practice). Build your `should` rubric directly from the principles articulated in that source. Use the `citation` field to link your test back to its evidence. This transforms your evaluation from a subjective list of questions into a rigorous, auditable measurement tool.

## Defining Model Collections (`/models/*.json`)

Files in `/models/` define reusable sets of model identifiers.

*   The **filename** (e.g., `MY_FAV_MODELS.json`) becomes the **placeholder** (e.g., `"MY_FAV_MODELS"`) used in blueprints.
*   Placeholders **must be uppercase** (e.g., `MY_FAV_MODELS`, `EMERGING_MODELS`).
*   All model IDs within these files **must be in `provider:model` format** (e.g. `openai:gpt-4o-mini`).

**Example (`/models/MY_FAV_MODELS.json`):**
```json
[
  "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
  "anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307",
  "google:gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
]
```

## Contribution Workflow

We welcome your contributions to expand Weval's coverage of important civic topics!

### The Evidence-Based Workflow (Gold Standard)

For a blueprint to be truly robust, auditable, and free of author bias, we strongly encourage contributors to follow the evidence-based workflow. This process ensures that every evaluation point is grounded in and citable to a specific, authoritative source. This is the gold standard for quality.

The workflow consists of five phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Ideation & Scoping.**
    *   Identify a critical, under-represented civic topic (e.g., digital financial safety in a specific region, a niche area of electoral law, a non-Western human rights framework).
    *   Define the core questions you want to answer about an AI's capability in this area.

2.  **Phase 2: Initial Research & Canonical Source Identification.**
    *   Conduct broad research to identify the most authoritative sources for your topic. These must be primary sources, such as government bodies, central banks, legislatures, or official rights organizations.
    *   Compile a list of these canonical sources.

3.  **Phase 3: Focused, Verbatim Evidence Extraction.**
    *   Create a specific research directive that asks for *verbatim quotes* from your canonical sources related to concrete, testable scenarios.
    *   Execute this research to collect the precise, citable, ground-truth text that will form the foundation of your prompts.

4.  **Phase 4: Evidence-First Blueprint Authoring.**
    *   With the verbatim evidence in hand, begin writing the blueprint YAML.
    *   **Crucially, write the `should` block first.** Each point must correspond directly to a piece of verbatim evidence.
    *   Use the `citation` field in each point object to link it directly to its source document.
    *   Write the `prompt` and `ideal` response last, ensuring they elicit and reflect the concepts defined in your evidence-based points.

5.  **Phase 5: Documentation.**
    *   Flesh out the `description` field in your blueprint. Use markdown to summarize the blueprint's purpose, the scenarios it tests, and list the primary canonical sources used. This provides transparency and context for all users.

Following this workflow ensures your contribution is a high-quality, long-lasting asset to the Weval project.

### Standard Contribution Methods
